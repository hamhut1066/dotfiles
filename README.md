Hamhut1066's Dotfiles
=====================

__Configs that can be applied to any linux install__

_A (hopefully) up to date record of all my dotfiles!_

- I am using a system where I clone into a .home dir in ~, then symlink what I need into ~


- This allows me to ignore what I don't need on some computers
