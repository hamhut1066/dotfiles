Hamhut1066's Dotfiles
=====================

**DEPRECATED:** now managed through nix, home-manager [moredhel/nur-packages](https://github.com/moredhel/nur-packages)

__Config for my OS X__

_A (hopefully) up to date record of all my dotfiles!_

- Todo, write a script that pulls in depencies, (oh-my-zsh, spacemacs...)
- I am using a system where I clone into a .home dir in ~, then symlink what I need into ~


- This allows me to ignore what I don't need on some computers
