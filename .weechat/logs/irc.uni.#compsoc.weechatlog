2013-10-10 16:57:02	Jammy	yes it is
2013-10-10 16:57:11	StrawHatter	An hour each way :/

2013-10-10 16:57:33	StrawHatter	would you be surprised if i said i can't read
2013-10-10 16:58:02	Jammy	no, because you're always being a bit of an attention whoring troll
2013-10-10 16:58:48	StrawHatter	<333
2013-10-10 16:58:54	StrawHatter	You know me oh so well <3
2013-10-10 16:59:38	Jammy	but seriously
2013-10-10 16:59:40	Jammy	Kindle
2013-10-10 16:59:53	Jammy	I've had one for 3 years now
2013-10-10 17:00:11	Jammy	and it's the only technology product I own that I haven't wanted to replace at some point
2013-10-10 17:00:15	Jammy	well, there's also the TV
2013-10-10 17:00:22	Jammy	but I've had that less than a year
2013-10-10 17:04:35	hamhut	my kindle saved my life
2013-10-10 17:04:58	hamhut	I have hundreds of books which I rotate on and off depending on what I think I can read.
2013-10-10 17:08:55	StrawHatter	Can you put manga on them?
2013-10-10 17:09:42	Fib	You can try but it emails your grandma to tell her what a disappointment you are
2013-10-10 17:10:14	Jammy	Fib: :D
2013-10-10 17:11:19	StrawHatter	Fib, it's totally fine, my family already knows i'm a disappointment I am <3
2013-10-10 17:11:49	hamhut	in pdf format... dunno how well it would work
2013-10-10 17:11:55	hamhut	I could have a quick go
2013-10-10 17:12:19	hamhut	dunno if you can view jpgs
2013-10-10 17:12:24	Jammy	read a proper book
2013-10-10 17:12:26	Jammy	hippie
2013-10-10 17:12:54	hamhut	I do normally :p (does Sci-Fi | Fantasy  count?)
2013-10-10 17:13:40	StrawHatter	Is it wrong that the last real book I read, was about 4 years ago..

2013-10-10 17:14:18	Jammy	yes, that's very wrong
2013-10-10 17:14:23	Jammy	books are amazing
2013-10-10 17:14:25	StrawHatter	how much are kindles?
2013-10-10 17:14:38	hamhut	dunno, about 60 quid, methinks
2013-10-10 17:14:48	Jammy	£69
2013-10-10 17:14:51	hamhut	close
2013-10-10 17:14:53	Jammy	but you should spring for the paperwhite
2013-10-10 17:14:58	StrawHatter	That's perfect
2013-10-10 17:14:59	Jammy	£109
2013-10-10 17:15:01	hamhut	agreed
2013-10-10 17:15:04	Jammy	it almost makes me want to upgrade
2013-10-10 17:15:13	Jammy	I probably will at some point
2013-10-10 17:15:21	hamhut	haha, I don't use mine enough at the moment to justify it
2013-10-10 17:15:36	hamhut	it currently taunts me every time I sit down to work
2013-10-10 17:15:48	Jammy	I use it on the toilet
2013-10-10 17:15:51	Jammy	and also when going to sleep
2013-10-10 17:16:29	StrawHatter	What's the difference? 
2013-10-10 17:17:20	Jammy	the paperwhite has an almost white screen
2013-10-10 17:17:28	Jammy	as opposed to the basically green of the normal one
2013-10-10 17:17:38	Jammy	also, it has a backlight you can use in the dark
2013-10-10 17:17:43	Jammy	also the resolution is higher
2013-10-10 17:18:57	Jammy	also a better battery
2013-10-10 17:19:06	Jammy	although the normal one has like 4 weeks anyway
2013-10-10 17:19:11	Jammy	so that's probably not relevant
2013-10-10 17:19:41	Reid	2 months of battery is fucking cool though
2013-10-10 17:20:25	Jammy	because putting it on charge once a month is such a difficulty? :P
2013-10-10 17:20:38	Jammy	the reason for the bigger battery is because of the backlight
2013-10-10 17:21:01	Jammy	I doubt many people actually get more life out of the paperwhite, because they'll be using the light sometimes
2013-10-10 17:21:04	Jammy	it's probably about the same
2013-10-10 17:21:47	Reid	It can technically manage 2 months. Whilst it's utterly pointless, it *is* cool.
2013-10-10 17:21:49	StrawHatter	What the fuck
2013-10-10 17:21:57	StrawHatter	What were they thinking?
2013-10-10 17:22:09	StrawHatter	"Oh hey guys, let's just give this fucking thing 2 months of battery life"
2013-10-10 17:22:44	Reid	Well why not?
2013-10-10 17:23:01	Reid	If it can make 2 months on low power usage, you'll get a solid length even on ridiculous usage
2013-10-10 17:23:09	Reid	Plus, to replace a book, it makes some kinda sense
2013-10-10 17:23:12	StrawHatter	I'm not complaining
2013-10-10 17:23:15	@StarScream	who wants their book to run out of battery
2013-10-10 17:23:15	Jammy	Reid: I wasn't saying it couldn't technically do that, I'm just pointing out that 1) In reality, most people's use won't allow that and 2) Having a month of battery rather than 2 is hardly an issue
2013-10-10 17:23:17	StrawHatter	It's actually amazing
2013-10-10 17:23:20	Reid	Toss it in your bag and forget about it, usually.
2013-10-10 17:23:42	Reid	Jammy: I wasn't saying you were. I was just saying that the fact it can manage that is, I agree, pointless, but still awesoem
2013-10-10 17:23:53	Jammy	the bigger battery is to deal with the backlight, not because they want it to last 2 months
2013-10-10 17:24:17	Reid	They stick 2 months on the marketing, for obvious reasons
2013-10-10 17:25:07	Jammy	giving figures in the way they do is pretty funny to me generally actually
2013-10-10 17:25:17	Jammy	they give the wifi off figures
2013-10-10 17:25:34	Jammy	so... really it should be a number of page turns
2013-10-10 17:25:41	Jammy	because there ain't much else using up battery
2013-10-10 17:27:48	Reid	That would make an absurd level of sense, actually
2013-10-10 17:28:10	Reid	Though I still want it more for h2g2-related reasons
2013-10-10 17:29:19	hamhut	but do you leave the wifi on always? mine is always off... I think I've turned it on 3-4 times in a year

2013-10-10 17:30:10	Jammy	mine is usually off too, but if you're not reading it, you can do more than a month :P
2013-10-10 17:30:45	Jammy	on the other hand, I used mine for like 3 hours a day in Finland and it lasted about 1.5 weeks instead
2013-10-10 17:31:15	Jammy	giving a time period that the battery lasts for on a Kindle is even more pointless than on most devices, because the amount of power used for a period of time is TINY
2013-10-10 17:31:16	hamhut	yeah, I haven't charged mine since about a month before coming to the uk
2013-10-10 17:31:23	Jammy	the only significant power usage is refreshing the screen
2013-10-10 17:31:40	Jammy	I understand that they're just giving an "average" value
2013-10-10 17:31:53	hamhut	when I used it heavily I would have to charge every 3 weeks
2013-10-10 17:31:54	Jammy	but there's going to be such a variance in how long people are reading for on average
2013-10-10 17:32:23	Jammy	anyway, I'm gonna head off now
2013-10-10 17:32:28	Jammy	before the man comes to replace my phone
2013-10-10 17:32:33	hamhut	also charge time is like an hour
2013-10-10 17:33:08	hamhut	what happened to the phone?

2013-10-13 23:24:52	@StarScream	right this instant
2013-10-13 23:24:53	StrawHatter	C# doesn't count does it?
2013-10-13 23:25:01	@StarScream	put down your knitting and get on with it
2013-10-13 23:25:06	R2ZER0	hahaha, no
2013-10-13 23:25:14	StrawHatter	if by knitting you mean playing pokemons, no
2013-10-13 23:25:26	@StarScream	knitting tho
2013-10-13 23:25:29	edran	hackers don't play pokemon. They MAKE pokemon.
2013-10-13 23:25:44	@StarScream	they ARE pokemon
2013-10-13 23:25:50	@StarScream	:o
2013-10-13 23:25:53	StrawHatter	and then hackers were pokemon
2013-10-13 23:25:57	edran	I've still got my custom firmware on my GameBoy.
2013-10-13 23:26:03	edran	That was good.
2013-10-13 23:26:11	@StarScream	what did it do
2013-10-13 23:27:06	edran	I could run a robot with it.
2013-10-13 23:27:11	edran	Actually, just a bunch of commands
2013-10-13 23:27:13	@StarScream	robots are fun
2013-10-13 23:27:20	edran	Truth.
2013-10-13 23:27:36	StrawHatter	can i be a robot?
2013-10-13 23:27:39	edran	but it was like ~2006
2013-10-13 23:27:40	@StarScream	ahh
2013-10-13 23:27:53	@StarScream	edran: is that you who just facebooked me?
2013-10-13 23:28:28	 *	StarScream tapes some tinfoil to StrawHatter
2013-10-13 23:28:33	@StarScream	robot!
2013-10-13 23:29:25	edran	StarScream: that's me being creepy as fuck, yes.
2013-10-13 23:30:02	@StarScream	sweet
2013-10-13 23:33:42	StrawHatter	okay, now you trade me and i evolve :D
2013-10-13 23:35:08	 *	edran yells: "Strawhatter, DIGIEVOLVE!"
2013-10-13 23:35:45	@StarScream	I dont think I have ever seen digimon
2013-10-13 23:36:07	@StarScream	as a child I was like ew pokemon is better and boycotted the fuck out of it
2013-10-13 23:36:26	edran	You should. It's a completely different setting/philosophy
2013-10-13 23:36:38	<--	Withad (~withad@211.50.208.46.dyn.plus.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-10-13 23:36:41	edran	Also, digimon happened before Pokemon...
2013-10-13 23:37:20	StrawHatter	digimon as a show was loads better than pokemons as well :/
2013-10-13 23:38:23	edran	Precisely. It's a much more mature anime than people expect.
2013-10-13 23:38:32	edran	Especially the first three series.
2013-10-13 23:38:36	edran	Then it became crap.
2013-10-13 23:39:48	StrawHatter	Tamers was dark as -bleep- like oh my gosh
2013-10-13 23:40:26	<--	leynos (~leynos@cpc9-sgyl32-2-0-cust529.18-2.cable.virginmedia.com) has quit (Quit: Off to dreams of Laserdiscs and Neo-Geos)
2013-10-13 23:41:02	edran	Well, there was some good HCI stuff in it. Especially on the metaphysical level
2013-10-13 23:41:34	edran	HCI : human computer interaction
2013-10-13 23:43:07	StrawHatter	When the little girl lost Leomon and was depressed for like, the rest of the series, I actually felt sorry for her
2013-10-13 23:43:35	edran	R2ZER0: I still haven't figured out who uses the COMPSOC account.
2013-10-13 23:43:42	edran	ah, lol
2013-10-13 23:43:48	@StarScream	I know it happened before pokemon now but when I was that young I didn't care for the facts
2013-10-13 23:43:52	edran	LOL, that was a fun episode.
2013-10-13 23:43:59	@StarScream	pokemon came into my life first thus superior
2013-10-13 23:44:06	@StarScream	edran: its a bot
2013-10-13 23:44:13	edran	Yeah, fair enough. I enjoyed it as a show :)
2013-10-13 23:44:31	edran	StarScream: That runs on Tardis, right?
2013-10-13 23:44:37	 *	StarScream shrugs
2013-10-13 23:44:52	@StarScream	I dont know if anybody knows any more
2013-10-13 23:45:01	edran	I want to populate this channel! In the committee we are thinking about ways to communicate with people. It is so hard.
2013-10-13 23:45:22	@StarScream	it gives me ops so I assume it wants me to keep order around here
2013-10-13 23:45:27	edran	So I'm trying to understand who are the ops and how it started.
2013-10-13 23:46:04	StrawHatter	yeah, far too many people don't use irc </3
2013-10-13 23:46:17	@StarScream	sciffy use it a fair bit which is nice
2013-10-13 23:46:29	KitB	This channel has been here forever
2013-10-13 23:47:02	@StarScream	before time began
2013-10-13 23:47:47	edran	Oh, hello Kit!
2013-10-13 23:48:21	edran	Yeah, that's the thing. I used IRC all the time in Italy at uni and I was expecting even more usage here.
2013-10-13 23:48:41	edran	But that doesn't happen. I wonder if things are just changing :P
2013-10-13 23:48:56	@StarScream	it used to be more popular
2013-10-13 23:49:29	edran	mmmmm
2013-10-13 23:50:37	@StarScream	mmmmmmmmmmmmm
2013-10-13 23:50:43	edran	I wonder if we should have a "learn IRC" session at the start of the year with the Unix one. For inf students is so useful to be able to go to channels and ask programming questions. #haskell, #python and #clang are pure gold sometimes.
2013-10-13 23:50:45	@StarScream	are we humming now? mmmmm
2013-10-13 23:51:01	StrawHatter	we have a #haskell channel?
2013-10-13 23:51:08	edran	Freenode does.
2013-10-13 23:51:28	@StarScream	#inf1 is a good place to ask haskell questions
2013-10-13 23:52:11	StrawHatter	d-does Don go on it?
2013-10-13 23:52:24	@StarScream	who is Don? idk i'm not in it
2013-10-13 23:52:45	StrawHatter	he's the new fp for haskell... probably explains why you don't know him 
2013-10-13 23:52:55	@StarScream	fp?
2013-10-13 23:53:01	StrawHatter	is everyone here in like, third and fourth year or something?
2013-10-13 23:53:10	StrawHatter	i got my words jumbled up
2013-10-13 23:53:19	StrawHatter	he's the new lecturer*
2013-10-13 23:53:22	@StarScream	I dropped out so neither of those things
2013-10-13 23:53:28	@StarScream	ohh, wadler 2.0
2013-10-13 23:53:38	StrawHatter	when did you drop out?
2013-10-13 23:53:46	@StarScream	last semester
2013-10-13 23:53:53	@StarScream	2nd year
2013-10-13 23:53:58	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-13 23:54:09	StrawHatter	i'm thinking of dropping out~
2013-10-13 23:54:19	edran	Hang on.
2013-10-13 23:54:22	@StarScream	you've just started
2013-10-13 23:54:26	stesh	:S
2013-10-13 23:54:26	@StarScream	dont
2013-10-13 23:54:40	StrawHatter	but, uni's sooooooo boooorrrriinnggg
2013-10-13 23:54:46	stesh	StrawHatter: it gets better!
2013-10-13 23:54:46	edran	Why is that? I mean, do you enjoy the subject?
2013-10-13 23:55:11	@StarScream	it gets better, yes first year is boring but stick with it
2013-10-13 23:55:13	StrawHatter	i thougt i did
2013-10-13 23:55:40	edran	Well, it depends. Have you joined any societies (apart from Compsoc)? Any clubs? 
2013-10-13 23:55:48	StrawHatter	N-No...
2013-10-13 23:56:29	edran	Uni is about you.
2013-10-13 23:56:45	edran	If you feel like is boring, before dropping out try to join some societies
2013-10-13 23:56:51	R2ZER0	edran: it's a bot
2013-10-13 23:56:52	edran	gamesoc is good for instance
2013-10-13 23:57:06	edran	R2ZER0: that would explain.
2013-10-13 23:57:14	@StarScream	dont drop out as soon as you start just cos its boring at first, yes first year is boring but you get to do so much more in later years
2013-10-13 23:57:31	@StarScream	also sciffy
2013-10-13 23:57:34	@StarScream	sciffy is good
2013-10-13 23:57:35	camerongray	R2ZER0: Never :P  You should know this!
2013-10-13 23:58:03	@StarScream	we meet on thursdays to watch shows then pub, and saturday is film night
2013-10-13 23:58:08	StrawHatter	isn't gamesoc just dota2 tho?
2013-10-13 23:58:18	@StarScream	no its not "just" anything
2013-10-13 23:58:19	edran	camerongray: check your ping man.
2013-10-13 23:58:26	@StarScream	its fuun
2013-10-13 23:58:33	camerongray	lol
2013-10-13 23:58:44	@StarScream	the lan I went to there was a robot unicorn attack tournament
2013-10-13 23:58:48	edran	Yeah!
2013-10-13 23:58:55	R2ZER0	camerongray: hmmmm, that is something we'll have to fix then eh ;)
2013-10-13 23:58:55	edran	And SSBM!
2013-10-13 23:59:04	R2ZER0	christmas party at hive
2013-10-13 23:59:06	--	You are now known as hamhut1066
2013-10-13 23:59:09	edran	camerongray: it is intevitable.
2013-10-13 23:59:12	camerongray	R2ZER0: You seriously hadn't realised? :P
2013-10-13 23:59:18	@StarScream	TF2 as well, which I am so bad at but its funsies
2013-10-13 23:59:22	R2ZER0	nope, i g
2013-10-13 23:59:30	edran	Yes.
2013-10-13 23:59:32	R2ZER0	figured you must've been dragged at least once
2013-10-13 23:59:40	camerongray	lol
2013-10-13 23:59:44	camerongray	It has been tried, many times
2013-10-13 23:59:51	camerongray	But always no
2013-10-14 00:00:02	R2ZER0	then you don't know the great secret
2013-10-14 00:00:41	camerongray	I know Broon, I know all the dark secrets of hive
2013-10-14 00:00:55	camerongray	Great, now I'm thinking of Broon's weekend "fun"
2013-10-14 00:01:10	@StarScream	hiiiive
2013-10-14 00:01:12	StrawHatter	plot twist, hive is owned by a giant queen bee
2013-10-14 00:01:16	R2ZER0	hehehe
2013-10-14 00:01:21	@StarScream	hive is a silly place
2013-10-14 00:03:02	camerongray	But yeah StrawHatter - Don't think about dropping out yet, the actual studies aren't super fun (at least at first) but the extra stuff like societies and other social events make up for it
2013-10-14 00:03:18	edran	^precisely
2013-10-14 00:03:24	camerongray	Along with pointless outside projects (Which I am the king of)
2013-10-14 00:03:59	StrawHatter	but my parents say i don't have time for soceitities :v
2013-10-14 00:04:23	@StarScream	... dude.
2013-10-14 00:04:26	camerongray	Ahh yeah, parents - They are an integral part of the university experience though
2013-10-14 00:04:55	camerongray	You should have plenty of free time - I juggle uni, work, social stuff and loads of small projects
2013-10-14 00:05:21	camerongray	Ahh, you're from Edinburgh then?
2013-10-14 00:05:26	StrawHatter	Nope
2013-10-14 00:05:34	StrawHatter	That'd be great if I was
2013-10-14 00:05:40	camerongray	Ahh, where about?
2013-10-14 00:05:41	edran	Where do you live?
2013-10-14 00:05:46	StrawHatter	Dunblane
2013-10-14 00:05:54	camerongray	Ahh yeah
2013-10-14 00:06:07	camerongray	Wait, were you at the games night?
2013-10-14 00:06:13	StrawHatter	i
2013-10-14 00:06:14	StrawHatter	was
2013-10-14 00:06:26	camerongray	I remember you - I was the guy with Zork :P
2013-10-14 00:06:47	StrawHatter	Zork? 
2013-10-14 00:06:59	camerongray	The old text based game
2013-10-14 00:07:07	edran	Dunblane? That's quite far! Why didn't you go into a uni accommodation (If I can ask)?
2013-10-14 00:07:13	KitB	Woo evening of Games
2013-10-14 00:07:20	 *	KitB relives past glories
2013-10-14 00:07:32	camerongray	KitB: You are a monster - Got me into KSP :P
2013-10-14 00:07:35	edran	That I missed because of frigging freshers week :'(
2013-10-14 00:07:37	KitB	Bwahahahaha
2013-10-14 00:07:53	edran	Kit, can we have another one? pretty please?
2013-10-14 00:08:02	KitB	Who's asking?
2013-10-14 00:08:09	StrawHatter	edran, I thought I was too young :P
2013-10-14 00:08:12	KitB	Ohai Nantas ^__^
2013-10-14 00:08:22	StrawHatter	cameron, OHH! I THINK I REMEMBER YOU!
2013-10-14 00:08:23	edran	ehiya!
2013-10-14 00:08:37	KitB	I'd be up for helping with another one for refreshers week perhaps
2013-10-14 00:08:41	camerongray	lol
2013-10-14 00:08:58	camerongray	I can bring more pointless DOS games :P
2013-10-14 00:09:01	edran	StrawHatter: I went to uni when I was 15. I know what it feels like :) You are never too young or too old, trust me!
2013-10-14 00:09:07	camerongray	Just ones that don't have non-ASCII graphics
2013-10-14 00:09:16	edran	KitB: <3
2013-10-14 00:09:19	camerongray	I stayed at home first year, moved out this year
2013-10-14 00:09:21	KitB	I'd like to shift the responsibility over to R2ZER0 though
2013-10-14 00:09:34	camerongray	Moving out certianly worked better (And I was in Edinburgh)
2013-10-14 00:09:35	KitB	In case I leave next year for the world of work
2013-10-14 00:09:42	edran	It's just that I want to smash you at SSBM
2013-10-14 00:09:48	KitB	Haha
2013-10-14 00:10:03	KitB	I didn't end up actually playing games in the evening of games except for a bout of KSP at the end
2013-10-14 00:10:24	camerongray	Then again, one of the reasons for me moving out was "Your keyboard is too loud" resulting in me having to have a different one for use at night
2013-10-14 00:10:29	StrawHatter	Why not, CompSoc vs GameSoc SSBM tourney ;)
2013-10-14 00:10:42	KitB	I'm not a fan of vs events
2013-10-14 00:10:51	KitB	or tournaments
2013-10-14 00:11:02	edran	same. Too complicated. It's better to just let chaos do the work
2013-10-14 00:11:03	KitB	Obviously I wouldn't stop anyone from organising them
2013-10-14 00:11:12	KitB	But I prefer the evening of games format
2013-10-14 00:11:28	KitB	Put as many systems and screens together as you can
2013-10-14 00:11:31	KitB	then invite people
2013-10-14 00:11:40	KitB	and buy them snacks, drinks, and pizza
2013-10-14 00:11:59	KitB	I would strongly recommend getting gamesoc involved again though
2013-10-14 00:12:12	edran	Will do.
2013-10-14 00:12:21	edran	For refreshers week at least.
2013-10-14 00:12:40	KitB	I would suggest running it as a joint event forever if they're up for it
2013-10-14 00:13:03	KitB	The only problem on their end is that most people ended up at the casual event and failed to notice the LAN in the next room
2013-10-14 00:13:06	edran	At the film screening we were talking about doing something with gamedevsoc as well
2013-10-14 00:13:33	edran	So big arrows is all we need. And LEDs, lots of LEDs.
2013-10-14 00:13:35	KitB	So either better advertising or just a casual evening would be a good idea
2013-10-14 00:14:14	KitB	Also we know we can get four projectors now
2013-10-14 00:14:27	KitB	as long as compsoc keeps up a relationship with the hacklab (via rob)
2013-10-14 00:14:41	KitB	and for as long as cameron is around
2013-10-14 00:14:50	KitB	Might be worth buying a compsoc projector tbh
2013-10-14 00:15:09	camerongray	lol
2013-10-14 00:15:25	KitB	Though I'm aware you try to leave the bank account with more money than you found it each year
2013-10-14 00:15:40	camerongray	StrawHatter: CompSoc is having a social on Tuesday - Should come to that
2013-10-14 00:15:49	edran	\whois rob
2013-10-14 00:15:59	edran	lol
2013-10-14 00:16:02	edran	damn it

2013-10-14 00:20:13	KitB	is that I'm saying these things in here
2013-10-14 00:20:23	KitB	and at least one of the people in here is a current tutee of mine.
2013-10-14 00:20:37	KitB	and there are maybe a couple of ex tutees too
2013-10-14 00:20:38	edran	999
2013-10-14 00:21:11	StrawHatter	guys
2013-10-14 00:21:15	StrawHatter	why are we all still awake lol
2013-10-14 00:21:20	edran	Well, that shold not really be a problem.
2013-10-14 00:21:45	edran	StrawHatter: Computer scientists do not sleep. Fact.
2013-10-14 00:22:19	StrawHatter	Then why are my CompSci buddies asleep? :c
2013-10-14 00:22:24	edran	Or if they do, they procrastinate sleep till death. Other fact.
2013-10-14 00:22:45	camerongray	I'm often up until 4am doing stuff :P
2013-10-14 00:23:06	edran	^ he writes PHP tho, so I wouldn't include him in the set.
2013-10-14 00:23:13	camerongray	lol!
2013-10-14 00:23:28	edran	you horrible horrible person.
2013-10-14 00:23:37	StrawHatter	edran, you said i should learn, Perl, Unix and C right?
2013-10-14 00:23:38	camerongray	Currently setting up a server :P
2013-10-14 00:24:15	edran	StrawHatter: Lisp too.
2013-10-14 00:24:36	StrawHatter	Blegh, I hate functional programming though </3
2013-10-14 00:25:53	edran	Lisp is multi-paradigm. Anyways, that's just me. Haskell and Java will do for now. Then python. Then fun :)
2013-10-14 00:26:40	StrawHatter	isn't C and Java quite a bit the same tho... Lemme rephrase that, isn't C and most languages the same tho?
2013-10-14 00:28:18	edran	Syntactically speaking, maybe. Most of the mainstream programming languages have adopted a certain standard that derived from C and the sort. This doesn't mean that learning Java will enable you to write C.
2013-10-14 00:28:30	edran	C is a completely different beast.
2013-10-14 00:28:52	KitB	I would interject to do tutoring stuff here, but edran seems to have it covered.
2013-10-14 00:28:57	KitB	<3
2013-10-14 00:29:31	edran	Whenever you want, KitB :)
2013-10-14 00:29:40	edran	When are your shifts?
2013-10-14 00:31:09	edran	Anyways, StrawHatter, what do you like of Computer Science? Maybe I can suggest you some fun ideas to experiment with what you learn at uni :)
2013-10-14 00:32:10	StrawHatter	the fact that i'm mediocerly good at it
2013-10-14 00:32:15	StrawHatter	no but really
2013-10-14 00:32:41	edran	Everybody is mediocre at some point. It gets better with practice!
2013-10-14 00:32:56	edran	Even my english will get better at some point! (I hope...)
2013-10-14 00:38:15	edran	So don't give up!
2013-10-14 00:39:32	edran	Learn some I/O management in haskell and think about something that you'd like to have on your OS. Something that makes you say "Man, this stuff is so boring and repetitive!". Then make a script to automatize what you normally do
2013-10-14 00:39:41	edran	Repeat ad infinitum.
2013-10-14 00:39:52	edran	???
2013-10-14 00:39:55	edran	Profit.
2013-10-14 00:39:57	edran	:)
2013-10-14 00:40:10	camerongray	I just buy ThinkPads and servers :P
2013-10-14 00:41:12	edran	^ Didn't I already say that you are an horrible, horrible person?
2013-10-14 00:41:15	edran	:P
2013-10-14 00:41:41	camerongray	lol
2013-10-14 00:41:46	camerongray	You have a ThinkPad :P
2013-10-14 00:41:59	camerongray	It's not like I'm buying Apple products or anything :P
2013-10-14 00:42:08	edran	That doesn't make me an horrible, horrible person.
2013-10-14 00:42:11	camerongray	Just pretend I don't own any

2013-10-14 00:42:52	camerongray	lol
2013-10-14 00:43:07	camerongray	Oh yeah edran, I have some super awesome gossip
2013-10-14 00:43:20	camerongray	R2ZER0 uses Windows 8 on his desktop :P
2013-10-14 00:43:28	edran	You getting to the Hive while drunk on Tuesday?
2013-10-14 00:43:31	edran	WHAT
2013-10-14 00:43:33	edran	WHAT
2013-10-14 00:43:36	edran	FUCKING WHAT
2013-10-14 00:43:46	camerongray	I use Arch 
2013-10-14 00:43:52	edran	R2ZER0: EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS. NOW.
2013-10-14 00:44:03	StrawHatter	Plot twist, it's 8.1
2013-10-14 00:44:06	camerongray	Oh yeah, my HTPC runs Windows 7
2013-10-14 00:44:15	camerongray	And guess what I use at work :P
2013-10-14 00:44:27	StrawHatter	Gentoo
2013-10-14 00:44:29	StrawHatter	- w -
2013-10-14 00:44:30	camerongray	Windows 7 and FreeBSD :D
2013-10-14 00:44:36	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-14 00:44:39	StrawHatter	at least i tried
2013-10-14 00:44:56	edran	Shut up. Shut up. KitB, how do I take possession of COMPSOC and permaban camerongray?
2013-10-14 00:45:00	camerongray	I love Arch though - Need to get it on my laptop
2013-10-14 00:45:22	edran	Do it.
2013-10-14 00:45:24	edran	But
2013-10-14 00:45:25	camerongray	But I'll just wait until they release the new ThinkPads - mmm
2013-10-14 00:45:26	edran	Rikki.
2013-10-14 00:45:34	edran	What the hell.
2013-10-14 00:45:35	stesh	edran: ride the next netsplit
2013-10-14 00:46:04	@StarScream	edran: or you could totes bribe me
2013-10-14 00:46:17	edran	I've got cookies.
2013-10-14 00:46:20	@StarScream	nah
2013-10-14 00:47:51	KitB	I run windows 8 on my desktop
2013-10-14 00:47:55	edran	Alright.
2013-10-14 00:48:00	edran	:O
2013-10-14 00:49:25	StrawHatter	I run Windoes 8 and Ubuntu 
2013-10-14 00:49:39	StrawHatter	Really should get Fedora Security or Kali soon :/
2013-10-14 00:49:42	KitB	my desktop lives in my living room and is used for gaming and Netflix for the most part
2013-10-14 00:50:04	edran	My soul is crying.
2013-10-14 00:50:21	KitB	for productivity I run mint on my laptop
2013-10-14 00:50:43	edran	+ openbox, wasn't it?
2013-10-14 00:50:53	KitB	xmonad
2013-10-14 00:51:25	KitB	xmonad on top of mate
2013-10-14 00:51:33	camerongray	Oh great KitB - Now edran is exploding with joy :P
2013-10-14 00:51:44	KitB	which is a fork of gnome 2
2013-10-14 00:51:48	edran	<3
2013-10-14 00:51:55	KitB	:D
2013-10-14 00:52:41	edran	I use Arch + pure xmonad for me. For research, ubuntu is necessary. ROS is basically Ubuntu only because of some pre-compiled libs
2013-10-14 00:53:11	KitB	I ran arch for a few years
2013-10-14 00:53:26	KitB	started using it in first year
2013-10-14 00:54:22	KitB	but I switched back to Ubuntu and derivatives earlier this year when I found out what a cock up the arch devs had made of the install process
2013-10-14 00:55:31	StrawHatter	Installing Arch is ridiculously funny/lengthy
2013-10-14 00:55:35	edran	I was part of the flame on IRC the day of the release.
2013-10-14 00:55:40	KitB	protip: deleting your curses script based installation process in favour of making the user run various scripts themselves is braindead 
2013-10-14 00:55:42	edran	It was horrible.
2013-10-14 00:56:30	edran	I think they may switch again at ome point
2013-10-14 00:56:35	KitB	I am completely capable of the new install process
2013-10-14 00:56:46	KitB	and had gotten a running system up
2013-10-14 00:57:52	KitB	when I realised I no longer want to bother with looking after my operating system
2013-10-14 00:59:07	edran	yeah, it's a fair point
2013-10-14 00:59:37	edran	I genuinely miss pacman on *buntu and derivatives
2013-10-14 00:59:44	edran	Aptitude just doesn't do it.
2013-10-14 00:59:47	KitB	and immediately installed mint-mate over it
2013-10-14 01:00:00	edran	How is mint?
2013-10-14 01:00:17	KitB	good enough that I don't care
2013-10-14 01:01:31	KitB	the wonderful thing about not running arch is not having to check the entire before doing any updates
2013-10-14 01:01:51	KitB	s/entire/website/
2013-10-14 01:02:02	KitB	(on a phone)
2013-10-14 01:02:38	KitB	because the update might beak my system such that I need to reinstall
2013-10-14 01:03:15	KitB	I became very wary of syu in the end
2013-10-14 01:05:13	KitB	that and having to deal with them deciding to make python point to python3 and renaming all the packages
2013-10-14 01:06:00	edran	Lning all the things has been the first thing I've done after installing arch on my new laptop
2013-10-14 01:06:10	KitB	anyway I have to go to sleep
2013-10-14 01:06:16	edran	after locking rm -rf /* maybe
2013-10-14 01:06:18	edran	me too
2013-10-14 01:06:38	KitB	Amy is threatening me with groin attacks
2013-10-14 01:06:55	edran	ouch
2013-10-14 01:07:09	StrawHatter	w-why would she do that? D:
2013-10-14 01:07:12	KitB	(she runs xmonad on mint too BTW)
2013-10-14 01:07:16	edran	Phd students.
2013-10-14 01:07:19	edran	<3
2013-10-14 01:07:32	edran	then she is allowed to threaten you. The school rep says so.
2013-10-14 01:07:38	edran	Deal with it.
2013-10-14 01:08:16	 *	KitB -> sleep

2013-10-14 01:09:29	KitB	edran: Amy asks if you're coming on Wednesday
2013-10-14 01:09:43	StrawHatter	l-lewd
2013-10-14 01:09:54	KitB	quite.
2013-10-14 01:10:49	edran	KitB: I'll try. I have a tutorial in the middle of the session, but I'll show up.
2013-10-14 01:11:01	edran	HAHA
2013-10-14 01:11:24	edran	sigh.

2013-10-14 14:12:22	Jammy	apparently there is one
2013-10-14 14:13:08	Jammy	at least that is what Kim said when I suggested that I was going to find another 42 members to sign a petition so we could have a vote on a constitutional amendment outlining our right to a weekly social
2013-10-14 14:13:35	Jammy	looking at what happened to the constitution since I stopped caring, it seems like it would no longer be the most stupid thing in there
2013-10-14 14:13:57	Jammy	guaranteed free pizza?
2013-10-14 14:14:18	Jammy	what happens when the ITO drop out of the informal arrangement and stop paying for STMUs?
2013-10-14 14:15:22	Jammy	could still provide pizza for a couple of years from what was saved up over the past 5 years, but there'd almost definitely be negative cash flow then
2013-10-14 14:19:31	Jammy	also, has anyone seen any of the new series of Parks and Rec?
2013-10-14 14:19:55	Jammy	there's some hilariously blatant Microsoft product placement
2013-10-14 14:20:10	Jammy	in addition to the usual Cisco stuff

2013-10-14 14:30:51	joe	we've since sold the SureMute division for lest than a tenth of what we bought the original startup for
2013-10-14 14:33:05	Jammy	joe: the Vimeo one won't load for me :(
2013-10-14 14:33:25	Jammy	is it the one where Jack is talking about how Cisco is the gold standard by which all enterprise hardware is judged?
2013-10-14 14:33:38	Jammy	I spat my tea out when I first saw that
2013-10-14 14:35:37	joe	yup :D
2013-10-14 14:36:54	Jammy	so what the hell did SureMute actually do?
2013-10-14 14:39:29	Jammy	I mean, I imagine it does some form of muting
2013-10-14 14:39:37	Jammy	but what makes it sure?
2013-10-14 14:39:49	Jammy	does it destroy the microphone or something?
2013-10-14 14:40:52	joe	it creates a soundproof bubble universe around the user, from which only light can escape
2013-10-14 14:41:04	Norgg	Does the opposite of FakeBlock.
2013-10-14 14:41:56	joe	I think you should consider calling it 'The' FakeBlock
2013-10-14 14:42:16	Jammy	why not LifeInvader?
2013-10-14 14:44:27	Jammy	I giggled like a little girl at the end of the LifeInvader mission
2013-10-14 14:45:25	joe	turns out somebody actually made something like FakeBlock: https://abine.com/
2013-10-14 14:46:06	Jammy	awwww man
2013-10-14 14:46:18	Jammy	I thought you meant like what FakeBlock actually was
2013-10-14 14:46:28	Jammy	rather than what Michael thought it was
2013-10-14 14:47:29	joe	which michael?
2013-10-14 14:48:31	Jammy	the Nichael one
2013-10-14 14:49:40	Jammy	although this maskme thing looks pretty cool

2013-10-14 18:23:00	edran	We are having problems with people who have signed up in Potterrow

2013-10-14 18:25:48	@StarScream	EUSA are the worst
2013-10-14 18:27:53	edran	It's just that they rewamped the system on September. Why would you do it on the first and most important month of the academic year for societies??

2013-10-14 21:53:51	edran	Jammy: That's what the School of Informatics does as well. We basically ignore whatever the uni says and we laugh at the IS.
2013-10-14 21:54:07	edran	That also mean that we have to produce all our tools, tho.
2013-10-14 21:54:21	edran	Luckily we are rich (Are we?)
2013-10-14 21:56:38	StrawHatter	So like, are we pmuch the most badass soceity and school of all?
2013-10-14 21:58:14	edran	The school is.
2013-10-14 21:58:17	edran	The society not yet.
2013-10-14 22:00:30	Jammy	the school has its problems too
2013-10-14 22:00:36	Jammy	like the absymal feedback scores
2013-10-14 22:02:03	edran	yeah, fair enough. I think they are trying to get better in this tho.
2013-10-14 22:02:18	edran	Michael and Alex (And last year, Ian) are doing a great job.
2013-10-14 22:02:39	Jammy	they've been fixing it for a number of years now
2013-10-14 22:03:02	Jammy	unfortunately, certain lecturers, who will remain unnamed, seem to still think that teaching is just an annoyance keeping them from proper work
2013-10-14 22:04:44	edran	I think one of the main problem is obviously that not everyone is willing to learn how to teach (but they are getting better in choosing the right people). The other one is that our mathematical curriculum sucks.
2013-10-14 22:05:00	edran	Because nobody is willing to teach the right math to Informatics students.
2013-10-14 22:05:31	Jammy	haha, it's vastly improved over before
2013-10-14 22:05:41	camerongray	And I can't understand our DMMR lecturer!
2013-10-14 22:05:47	Jammy	still mostly irrelevant, but it should now have half decent lecturers
2013-10-14 22:06:01	edran	I wish.
2013-10-14 22:06:26	Jammy	gather round children, while I tell you the history of maths in informatics
2013-10-14 22:06:26	edran	The problem is with the course. DMMR introduces discrete mathematics well
2013-10-14 22:06:36	StrawHatter	"Not yet"
2013-10-14 22:06:38	StrawHatter	upupupupuupu
2013-10-14 22:06:39	edran	but it tries to do probability and algos as well.
2013-10-14 22:07:00	edran	when there are two courses in the second semester that are only focused on those two subjects.
2013-10-14 22:07:00	Jammy	once upon a time, the school of informatics asked the school of maths to teach maths to the inf students
2013-10-14 22:07:09	Jammy	and included a syllabus that should be taught
2013-10-14 22:07:09	edran	and kittens cried.
2013-10-14 22:07:15	Jammy	full of relevant and interesting maths
2013-10-14 22:07:26	edran	DMMR is from our School, tho.
2013-10-14 22:07:42	Jammy	over the course of about a decade, the school of maths decided they preferred some other things
2013-10-14 22:07:53	StrawHatter	10/10
2013-10-14 22:08:00	Jammy	so they took out all of the relevant bits (except RSA cryptosystems)
2013-10-14 22:08:04	StrawHatter	Best story i've heard all day
2013-10-14 22:08:14	Jammy	and also, as it was only taught to inf students, they put their worst lecturers on it
2013-10-14 22:08:23	Jammy	why give the non-maths students the decent lecturers, eh?
2013-10-14 22:08:57	Jammy	anyway, informatics started talking about taking the maths back
2013-10-14 22:09:00	edran	Jammy: now in the 1st year we take the same courses of the maths students, but in the 2nd year we have DMMR, which is from our school.
2013-10-14 22:09:05	Jammy	and maths kicked off
2013-10-14 22:09:22	Jammy	and the college of science and engineering were like "No way"
2013-10-14 22:09:39	Jammy	after another year of arguing, a compromise was reached
2013-10-14 22:09:45	Jammy	which is what you're at now
2013-10-14 22:10:02	Jammy	and it *should* be a LOT better than what the old course was
2013-10-14 22:10:24	Jammy	I say this as someone that took the old course, and was part of the committee that approved the new course
2013-10-14 22:10:56	Jammy	ultimately, inf students will probably always hate maths, because you need a lot of mathematical background you weren't expecting
2013-10-14 22:11:04	edran	I'm in the committee now
2013-10-14 22:11:38	edran	Mathematics is awesome and I was quite happy about last year courses. The problem is DMMR.
2013-10-14 22:11:55	Jammy	well fix it then :P
2013-10-14 22:12:09	Jammy	seriously, 1 bad course is better than 4
2013-10-14 22:12:17	edran	Yeah, that's fair
2013-10-14 22:12:18	Jammy	so there's been a VAST improvement
2013-10-14 22:13:39	Jammy	so what's the problem with this DMMR thing?
2013-10-14 22:13:47	edran	Well
2013-10-14 22:15:43	edran	Basically the course syllabus is too big. They try to give a general understanding of a lot of subjects in one go. They also introduce Algos and Probability as two big topics. Now, the thing is that there are 2B and Probability with Applications in the second semester, so it's basically redundant, on top of being utterly stupid.
2013-10-14 22:16:01	edran	On top of that, the lecturers don't know how to teach.
2013-10-14 22:16:14	Jammy	who's lecturing it?
2013-10-14 22:16:33	StrawHatter	i dunno man, maths was kinda boring for me :/
2013-10-14 22:16:37	StrawHatter	Linear Algebra </3
2013-10-14 22:16:38	edran	Mayr and Etessami
2013-10-14 22:17:06	edran	StrawHatter: Try to find some applications. You'll start to love it as soon as you do :) Give project euler a shot as well.
2013-10-14 22:17:52	edran	Mayr loves the course, but he is simply unable to teach well (monotone voice, zero expressivity, reads the slides)
2013-10-14 22:18:11	StrawHatter	I dunno, it's really boring to me
2013-10-14 22:18:39	edran	Etessami just gives the feeling of not knowing the subject (but tbf we've had him only one time so far, so he may be better)
2013-10-14 22:18:50	StrawHatter	Like, none of it screams "This is essential for compoopers" apart from like the stuff with Z 5 or something
2013-10-14 22:19:10	Jammy	StrawHatter: it will all make sense in 3rd/4th year
2013-10-14 22:20:04	edran	StrawHatter: All Introduction to Linear Algebra is essential in robotics, game developing, quantum computing, discrete programming and so on. Stick with it, trust us.
2013-10-14 22:20:17	edran	They don't even teach you the real deal
2013-10-14 22:20:19	Jammy	also I don't really know either of those people
2013-10-14 22:20:21	edran	Yet.
2013-10-14 22:20:30	Jammy	but Etessami seems to have some pretty bro research
2013-10-14 22:20:42	Jammy	he almost definitely knows what he's talking about
2013-10-14 22:21:04	edran	Yes, but being a good researcher doesn't imply being a good lecturer :/
2013-10-14 22:21:19	<--	Withad (~withad@211.50.208.46.dyn.plus.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-10-14 22:21:20	edran	I hope they get better. I really do.
2013-10-14 22:21:41	Jammy	never said it did, but you said he gives the feeling of not knowing the subject
2013-10-14 22:21:45	Jammy	I'm just saying that he does :P
2013-10-14 22:21:49	Jammy	not that he's a good lecturer
2013-10-14 22:22:00	edran	Ah, sorry, fair enough :P
2013-10-14 22:22:10	Jammy	either way, by being on the committee, you mean you're a school rep?
2013-10-14 22:22:30	edran	I mean, they all know their stuff. They should at least, so I'll never doubt that.
2013-10-14 22:22:33	edran	Yes.
2013-10-14 22:22:40	Jammy	because now that the FTL (I can't remember the new name) meetings are closed, you're the one that needs to work on fixing it
2013-10-14 22:22:53	Jammy	when I were a lad, anyone could turn up to FTL meetings if they had an issue
2013-10-14 22:22:58	Jammy	I have no idea why that was changed
2013-10-14 22:23:07	edran	The university messed things up
2013-10-14 22:23:37	edran	They were trying to make uni-wide policies for school feedback
2013-10-14 22:23:50	StrawHatter	...
2013-10-14 22:23:53	edran	but our school does everything differently
2013-10-14 22:24:01	StrawHatter	s/-BLEEP-
2013-10-14 22:24:05	StrawHatter	ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?
2013-10-14 22:24:13	StrawHatter	I HAVE TO DO IT UNTIL 4TH YEAR?!
2013-10-14 22:24:22	Jammy	but that doesn't mean the FTL meetings had to go, right?
2013-10-14 22:24:23	edran	What's your degree?
2013-10-14 22:24:27	StrawHatter	EXCUSE ME WHILST I GO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
2013-10-14 22:24:29	StrawHatter	um
2013-10-14 22:24:29	StrawHatter	idk
2013-10-14 22:24:34	StrawHatter	some compooper science one
2013-10-14 22:24:35	Jammy	StrawHatter: The maths you learn now will be useful in 3rd and 4th year
2013-10-14 22:24:47	Jammy	you stop learning maths after 2nd year
2013-10-14 22:24:59	Jammy	they don't just teach you it to annoy you, it's useful stuff
2013-10-14 22:25:02	edran	StrawHatter: sort of. We set a new kind of meeting. People can turn up, but basically there are already ~15 reps every time
2013-10-14 22:25:06	edran	so It's not too bad
2013-10-14 22:25:10	edran	ops
2013-10-14 22:25:11	StrawHatter	Thank god
2013-10-14 22:25:15	StrawHatter	I was actually worried for a moment
2013-10-14 22:25:16	edran	I meant Jammy 
2013-10-14 22:25:28	StrawHatter	Do I do Linear Algebra in year 2 as well?
2013-10-14 22:25:33	edran	No.
2013-10-14 22:25:38	Jammy	edran: See, that's the bit I don't understand
2013-10-14 22:26:00	edran	Jammy: we have the meeting on Wed at 1pm on AT4
2013-10-14 22:26:16	Jammy	why require a bunch of elected reps to turn up, when some of them won't have any issues to raise and some classes *will* have issues, but will have lazy reps that don't turn up?
2013-10-14 22:26:23	StrawHatter	Life is suddenly 10 times better
2013-10-14 22:26:29	StrawHatter	Thank you based Linus 
2013-10-14 22:26:35	Jammy	the FTL meetings were Wed at 1pm on AT4, but open to anyone with an issue
2013-10-14 22:26:35	edran	Jammy: because Uni/EUSA requires it now.
2013-10-14 22:26:42	edran	ANybody can still come
2013-10-14 22:26:47	Jammy	WHAT?
2013-10-14 22:26:50	edran	It's just that it's not advertised.
2013-10-14 22:26:51	Jammy	I was told you couldn't do that
2013-10-14 22:26:55	edran	I did last year.
2013-10-14 22:26:59	Jammy	James Hulme lied to me
2013-10-14 22:27:02	Jammy	fucking asshole
2013-10-14 22:27:03	edran	I wasn't a rep. I came anyways all the time
2013-10-14 22:27:24	Jammy	so basically, nothing has changed?
2013-10-14 22:27:26	edran	Slap James next time you see him
2013-10-14 22:27:27	edran	basically
2013-10-14 22:27:34	Jammy	fucking asshole
2013-10-14 22:27:39	Jammy	I had issues to raise!
2013-10-14 22:27:42	edran	It's just that now it's not advertised in classes or emails
2013-10-14 22:27:47	edran	tell me, I'll do it.
2013-10-14 22:27:56	edran	or just come along :)
2013-10-14 22:28:06	Jammy	school reps refused to talk until you'd been to class reps
2013-10-14 22:28:13	edran	what?
2013-10-14 22:28:14	Jammy	class reps in 4th year is an... interesting concept
2013-10-14 22:28:22	edran	WHAT?
2013-10-14 22:28:34	Jammy	yeah, now you see my problem!
2013-10-14 22:28:40	edran	okay, all lies
2013-10-14 22:28:52	Jammy	the way it used to work (and sounds like it still does), is that you can just turn up if you want
2013-10-14 22:29:04	Jammy	if you don't want to turn up, speak to a class rep or school rep and they'll do it for you
2013-10-14 22:29:08	edran	Since I care, I'll probably be in the meetings all the years.
2013-10-14 22:29:11	Jammy	the way it should be
2013-10-14 22:29:15	edran	yeah
2013-10-14 22:29:20	edran	that's the way it is
2013-10-14 22:29:27	Jammy	sweet
2013-10-14 22:29:35	Jammy	also, it's too late for me to raise issues now
2013-10-14 22:29:36	StrawHatter	Fug
2013-10-14 22:29:38	Jammy	been there
2013-10-14 22:29:39	Jammy	donethat
2013-10-14 22:29:42	StrawHatter	I had maths homework
2013-10-14 22:29:42	Jammy	got the piece of paper
2013-10-14 22:29:43	edran	Michael, Alex and Ian are very relaxed about that.
2013-10-14 22:29:44	StrawHatter	brb crying
2013-10-14 22:29:49	edran	oh, you already graduated?
2013-10-14 22:30:06	Jammy	earlier this year, yeah
2013-10-14 22:30:24	edran	GZ!
2013-10-14 22:30:34	edran	Still in Edinburgh I see :)
2013-10-14 22:30:38	Jammy	it's awesome because suddenly you do worthwhile work and get money for doing it
2013-10-14 22:31:01	edran	I'll come to the next Tardis so that we can have a pint and discuss about pointless things the school is doing :D
2013-10-14 22:31:08	edran	I can imagine
2013-10-14 22:31:42	Jammy	my requirements were Edinburgh or Finland
2013-10-14 22:32:05	edran	Definitely a good choice then
2013-10-14 22:32:09	Jammy	and then before I managed to get any applications sent, I got an offer from one of the places I interned
2013-10-14 22:32:10	edran	Skyscanner or Amazon?
2013-10-14 22:32:15	Jammy	Cisco :P
2013-10-14 22:32:22	edran	Ah, damn :D they are evil!
2013-10-14 22:32:25	edran	(jk, jk)
2013-10-14 22:32:31	Jammy	never skyscanner
2013-10-14 22:32:40	Jammy	it's like going full retard
2013-10-14 22:32:49	edran	they use M$ software, true.
2013-10-14 22:33:13	Jammy	nahhh, I'm more concerned with the stories coming from people who left
2013-10-14 22:33:31	edran	For me it's abig fucking deal tho :)
2013-10-14 22:34:02	Jammy	Cisco just lets you install what you want to
2013-10-14 22:34:20	Jammy	although you will need an OS X / Windows VM for webex
2013-10-14 22:35:50	Jammy	the people that decide to Linux it up seem to have a bad time though
2013-10-14 22:36:10	Jammy	so many meetings of waiting 15 minutes for someone to try and get the projector working
2013-10-14 22:38:36	Jammy	edran: which year are you in?
2013-10-14 22:38:40	edran	2
2013-10-14 22:39:14	edran	Cisco should be a cool place to work in
2013-10-14 22:40:00	Jammy	you could apply for an internship there! :P
2013-10-14 22:40:14	Jammy	it'll say you need to be penultimate year, but just ignore it
2013-10-14 22:40:41	edran	I'm doing research, so my summers are already busy :)
2013-10-14 22:40:51	edran	But thanks for the offer!
2013-10-14 22:40:54	Jammy	ewwwwwww
2013-10-14 22:40:57	Jammy	research
2013-10-14 22:41:13	stesh	rom Queue import PriorityQueue
2013-10-14 22:41:20	stesh	eh
2013-10-14 22:41:24	stesh	whoops, don't mind me :S
2013-10-14 22:41:26	edran	the only place I'm considering is Google, only because they have that NLP research centre
2013-10-14 22:41:29	edran	hehe
2013-10-14 22:41:49	edran	No, I'm an RA in IPAB, under the RAD group
2013-10-14 22:41:54	edran	robots and stuff
2013-10-14 22:42:05	edran	(Actually, I'm just a slave, but ssshhhh)
2013-10-14 22:43:51	edran	But I've got a nice supervisor :)
2013-10-14 22:44:01	Jammy	who is it?
2013-10-14 22:44:04	Jammy	it it Taku?
2013-10-14 22:44:05	Jammy	TAKU!
2013-10-14 22:45:55	edran	Ram
2013-10-14 22:46:10	edran	he was lecturing IVR a couple of years ago
2013-10-14 22:46:24	edran	Not Taku :P
2013-10-14 22:47:31	edran	Unfortunately I don't get to work with takamura :'(
2013-10-14 22:47:47	edran	He's into vision, which I don't really fancy.
2013-10-14 22:48:35	Jammy	Ram!
2013-10-14 22:48:47	Jammy	he was the leader of my project group
2013-10-14 22:48:49	Jammy	I never turnedu p
2013-10-14 22:48:54	Jammy	turned up*
2013-10-14 22:49:01	edran	:O
2013-10-14 22:49:06	edran	that's a shame!
2013-10-14 22:49:23	edran	4th year project or what?
2013-10-14 22:49:33	Jammy	4th year project
2013-10-14 22:49:37	Jammy	I turned up once I think
2013-10-14 22:49:39	Jammy	maybe twice
2013-10-14 22:50:21	edran	was it last year? I hope not. He was *terribly* busy all the time.
2013-10-14 22:50:26	edran	He still is, tho.
2013-10-14 22:50:34	Jammy	it was last year, yeah
2013-10-14 22:50:45	Jammy	it's ok, there were only like 3 or 4 meetings
2013-10-14 22:50:45	edran	I have a meeting with him tomorrow at like 0830
2013-10-14 22:50:51	edran	the IF is desert at that time
2013-10-14 22:50:56	Jammy	the groups are like 4 people
2013-10-14 22:51:11	Jammy	and you meet once every couple of months to show off how far you are
2013-10-14 22:51:42	edran	fair enough. He's really a good guy, you would have enjoyed  the meetings :)
2013-10-14 22:51:53	edran	you end up chatting about anything with him.
2013-10-14 22:51:56	edran	Which is really cool.
2013-10-14 22:52:53	edran	I'll tell him you said Hi :P
2013-10-14 22:54:33	Jammy	he won't know who I am
2013-10-14 22:54:37	Jammy	Taku might
2013-10-14 22:54:45	Jammy	and then would probably be like "SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT"
2013-10-14 22:56:12	Jammy	if you say hi to anyone for me, it should be Stuart
2013-10-14 22:56:15	Jammy	that man is a legend
2013-10-14 22:56:20	StrawHatter	guys
2013-10-14 22:56:22	edran	ahah
2013-10-14 22:56:30	StrawHatter	what do if i don't wanna do homeowkr for tutorial?
2013-10-14 22:56:31	edran	You'd be surprised ;)
2013-10-14 22:56:34	StrawHatter	homework*
2013-10-14 22:57:01	edran	Just skip it. It's not a big deal. Remember to do it at some point tho, because they are much more useful than lectures.
2013-10-14 22:57:16	edran	But really, try a bit.
2013-10-14 22:57:27	Jammy	I almost spoke to Stuart a couple of weeks ago
2013-10-14 22:57:29	edran	Math is all about pattern recognition during UG
2013-10-14 22:57:38	Jammy	I was in the forum for a conference and I saw him!
2013-10-14 22:57:51	Jammy	but he disappeared before I got a chance to say hi
2013-10-14 22:58:20	edran	why don't you just pop in his office?
2013-10-14 22:59:16	edran	He should still be on the 3rd floor
2013-10-14 22:59:23	edran	I see him around sometimes.
2013-10-14 22:59:51	edran	yeah, 3.46
2013-10-14 23:01:42	Jammy	can't get in to the forum :P
2013-10-14 23:01:51	Jammy	maybe if there is another conference sometime
2013-10-14 23:02:49	edran	yeah you can
2013-10-14 23:03:13	-->	gabriel (~gabriel@cpc2-sgyl34-2-0-cust494.sgyl.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #compsoc
2013-10-14 23:03:19	edran	You can just write "Alumni business" at the entrance
2013-10-14 23:04:52	gabriel	Hullo
2013-10-14 23:06:27	edran	ai
2013-10-14 23:10:21	gabriel	what's an Aspen?
2013-10-14 23:10:45	edran	It's a pub
2013-10-14 23:11:02	edran	or just a tree
2013-10-14 23:11:09	gabriel	Where does it live?
2013-10-14 23:11:12	edran	actually, it's a family of trees.
2013-10-14 23:11:26	edran	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen
2013-10-14 23:11:28	gabriel	it's the largest living organism
2013-10-14 23:11:32	lambdabot	Title: Aspen - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
2013-10-14 23:11:57	gabriel	so large
2013-10-14 23:13:10	gabriel	ok so I searched aspen in google maps for directions but how can I be sure that it's the bar and not a tree or family of trees
2013-10-14 23:13:41	gabriel	tell me lambdabot
2013-10-14 23:16:48	edran	If you want, you can trust a random stranger on IRC. 
2013-10-14 23:16:59	edran	I'll telly ou where to go.
2013-10-14 23:17:01	edran	*tell
2013-10-14 23:18:43	gabriel	I'll take my chances with google maps not because I don't trust you
2013-10-14 23:18:50	edran	Anyways, Aspen is basically next to Blackwells
2013-10-14 23:19:17	gabriel	it's because now I'm excited about trees
2013-10-14 23:19:43	edran	You may want to check r/dogs
2013-10-14 23:20:49	gabriel	r/birdswitharms
2013-10-14 23:22:28	edran	that too
2013-10-14 23:22:32	StrawHatter	what's a tree?
2013-10-14 23:22:34	StrawHatter	...
2013-10-14 23:22:34	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-14 23:22:36	StrawHatter	nvm
2013-10-14 23:22:41	StrawHatter	everyone just forget that pls

2013-10-14 23:23:26	gabriel	huh?
2013-10-14 23:25:11	hamhut1066	does anyone know how to represent span geometrically?
2013-10-14 23:26:21	gabriel	yeah
2013-10-14 23:26:23	gabriel	yes
2013-10-14 23:26:37	StrawHatter	hamhut
2013-10-14 23:26:40	StrawHatter	you doing the maths as well?
2013-10-14 23:26:42	gabriel	can't you just do that thing where you draw a grid using two non-colinear vectors
2013-10-14 23:26:43	hamhut1066	yeah
2013-10-14 23:26:51	StrawHatter	just
2013-10-14 23:26:52	StrawHatter	don't do it
2013-10-14 23:26:55	StrawHatter	and see what happens
2013-10-14 23:27:16	hamhut1066	okay, I used a 3d axis, but then there are lots of lines
2013-10-14 23:27:25	edran	You can do that as well
2013-10-14 23:27:49	hamhut1066	but it looks odd and could get confusing in Rn n > 3 dimensions
2013-10-14 23:27:50	StrawHatter	>anything grids
2013-10-14 23:27:53	StrawHatter	you guys lost me
2013-10-14 23:27:54	StrawHatter	good job
2013-10-14 23:28:19	StrawHatter	also
2013-10-14 23:28:25	StrawHatter	why am i watching made in chelsea
2013-10-14 23:28:28	StrawHatter	is this
2013-10-14 23:28:32	edran	hamhut1066: can't you stick with 2D?
2013-10-14 23:28:33	StrawHatter	really what my life has come to?
2013-10-14 23:28:34	StrawHatter	</3
2013-10-14 23:28:59	hamhut1066	it asks me to represent the span of 3 3D vectors geometrically
2013-10-14 23:29:04	hamhut1066	edran
2013-10-14 23:29:10	Jammy	StrawHatter: shit's good
2013-10-14 23:29:19	edran	oh damn
2013-10-14 23:29:21	Jammy	I like Binky's mum
2013-10-14 23:29:29	hamhut1066	Jammy: I tried, it hurt too much
2013-10-14 23:29:32	StrawHatter	Jammy, I'm literally just watching the one e4 right now
2013-10-14 23:29:42	edran	The span is just the set of all linear combination of vectors, if I remember well
2013-10-14 23:30:14	hamhut1066	yeah, so it's easy algebreacally... but don't know how to represent it geometrically
2013-10-14 23:30:20	StrawHatter	Wait what
2013-10-14 23:30:21	edran	so make an area
2013-10-14 23:30:26	edran	draw the 3 vectors
2013-10-14 23:30:30	StrawHatter	I feel like it was a bad idea to just flat out missout Spans
2013-10-14 23:30:30	edran	actually, a volume
2013-10-14 23:30:31	gabriel	Just take a marker
2013-10-14 23:30:45	hamhut1066	maybe I'll draw a plane with 2 of the vectors then use the 3rd one to move the plane
2013-10-14 23:30:48	gabriel	no scratch that
2013-10-14 23:30:56	gabriel	put the marker away
2013-10-14 23:31:21	hamhut1066	okay, marker is down
2013-10-14 23:31:22	gabriel	I think you've got it. What class is that for?
2013-10-14 23:31:29	hamhut1066	Linear algebra

2013-10-14 23:31:54	StrawHatter	w-woah
2013-10-14 23:31:55	gabriel	yeah so do the grid thing, but at perspective
2013-10-14 23:32:15	gabriel	and then just throw a z on there
2013-10-14 23:32:15	StrawHatter	i'm just gonna skip my tutorial tomorrow
2013-10-14 23:32:23	gabriel	yeah just drop out

2013-10-14 23:34:01	hamhut1066	yeah, first pro gamer on a linux rig
2013-10-14 23:34:02	StrawHatter	then have a drug scandal and flat out gain reputation as the first major e-sports player to have a drug problem and have it on all news stations
2013-10-14 23:34:34	hamhut1066	that would be pretty cool!
2013-10-14 23:34:44	edran	guys. Hold on.

2013-10-14 23:49:26	hamhut1066	it's pretty good so far, was really lucky because I picked a water pokemon as my starting one, owned the first gym. After reasising that there is now a curve ball in their lineup

2013-10-14 23:51:17	StrawHatter	Console? 3DS.
2013-10-14 23:51:29	hamhut1066	I'm using desmume... will it work on that?

2013-10-15 13:16:56	Jammy	shit*
2013-10-15 13:17:01	Jammy	and ordered a hat
2013-10-15 13:17:05	Jammy	and it never turned up
2013-10-15 13:17:09	Jammy	and they just ignored me
2013-10-15 13:17:12	Jammy	WHERE'S MY FUCKING HAT?
2013-10-15 13:17:24	StrawHatter	my gosh, this is worse than TF2
2013-10-15 13:17:31	StrawHatter	The whole hat thing I mean
2013-10-15 13:18:18	Jammy	non-virtual hat
2013-10-15 13:18:28	StrawHatter	but
2013-10-15 13:18:30	Jammy	if they're like "Collect stars and then you can get things!"
2013-10-15 13:18:35	StrawHatter	Nintendo does release grown up games
2013-10-15 13:18:36	Jammy	and most of the things are crappy wallpapers
2013-10-15 13:18:40	Jammy	but then there's a hat
2013-10-15 13:18:44	Jammy	so you order the hat
2013-10-15 13:18:47	Jammy	and it never shows up
2013-10-15 13:18:59	StrawHatter	maybe you never ordered thehat
2013-10-15 13:19:02	Jammy	so you call them and they're like "We sent the hat, not our problem"
2013-10-15 13:19:05	StrawHatter	maybe the hat ordered you
2013-10-15 13:19:28	StrawHatter	i'm waiting for the day 10 years later
2013-10-15 13:19:37	StrawHatter	when the mailman finally delivers the hat
2013-10-15 13:19:41	StrawHatter	and you're just all 
2013-10-15 13:19:51	StrawHatter	"Well damn, I guess they did deliver it after all"
2013-10-15 13:21:06	Jammy	I'm not arguing that they didn't send it
2013-10-15 13:21:12	Jammy	they may have done, they may not have done
2013-10-15 13:21:21	Jammy	but either way, they have a duty to get my hat to me!
2013-10-15 13:21:43	StrawHatter	:ccc
2013-10-15 13:22:01	Jammy	if you buy a TV from Amazon and it goes missing before it gets to you, are you just like "Oh well, they sent it. It's my fault."?
2013-10-15 13:22:03	Jammy	no!
2013-10-15 13:22:14	Jammy	you call Amazon and you're like "WHERE'S MY GODDAMN TV"
2013-10-15 13:22:34	Jammy	and they're like "We're sorry it went missing. We'll send you a new one right away."
2013-10-15 13:23:15	Jammy	also, which grown up games do Nintendo make?
2013-10-15 13:23:35	Jammy	if you can't watch the brains flying out as the head explodes, it doesn't count
2013-10-15 13:32:36	hamhut1066	StrawHatter: I'll have to keep an eye out for you, make your presence known
2013-10-15 13:35:04	StrawHatter	nty

2013-10-15 13:41:48	StrawHatter	I was gonna join in with your Linux/GNU chat
2013-10-15 13:42:01	StrawHatter	But I thought to myself that I didn't wanna seem like an idiot if I said something wrong qq

2013-10-15 15:56:20	StrawHatter	that probably explains why i haven't been enjoying it as much as others :/
2013-10-15 15:56:55	Jammy	probably
2013-10-15 15:56:59	hamhut1066	have you joined any societies?
2013-10-15 15:57:03	Jammy	what do you do between lectures?
2013-10-15 15:57:16	StrawHatter	I joined this one
2013-10-15 15:57:27	StrawHatter	I'll "study" 
2013-10-15 15:57:28	Jammy	because the correct thing to be doing is sitting around on AT3 and speaking to people about computers
2013-10-15 15:57:32	StrawHatter	or just compuper
2013-10-15 15:57:39	Jammy	pffft, don't study between lectures
2013-10-15 15:57:43	Jammy	you can do that at home
2013-10-15 15:58:01	Jammy	seeing as you live far away, you should be using that time to try and get to know people on your course
2013-10-15 15:58:12	StrawHatter	but my friends only come in like 10 minutes before a lecture starts
2013-10-15 15:58:36	Jammy	do you not have any lectures with like a 2 hour gap between them or something?
2013-10-15 15:58:57	StrawHatter	Most of mine have about a 2-3 hour gap
2013-10-15 15:59:17	Jammy	and everyone goes home for that gap?
2013-10-15 15:59:28	StrawHatter	mhm
2013-10-15 15:59:45	StrawHatter	is that bad?
2013-10-15 16:00:06	Jammy	you kids are weird
2013-10-15 16:00:29	StrawHatter	xcus u
2013-10-15 16:00:33	StrawHatter	i don't do that
2013-10-15 16:00:46	Jammy	does it coincide with lunch time?
2013-10-15 16:00:51	Jammy	persuade them to get lunch with you
2013-10-15 16:01:02	hamhut1066	haha, you don't have a choice... and I normally don't
2013-10-15 16:01:15	hamhut1066	unless I have 4 hour gaps.
2013-10-15 16:01:28	StrawHatter	FUCK
2013-10-15 16:01:35	StrawHatter	I FORGOT TO GO THE BANK
2013-10-15 16:01:36	StrawHatter	UGH
2013-10-15 16:01:38	Jammy	I seem to remember that it  kind of fixes itself eventually
2013-10-15 16:01:41	StrawHatter	brb crying
2013-10-15 16:01:52	Jammy	when people realise there's no point in going home for 2 hours
2013-10-15 16:02:03	Jammy	go to the bank now?
2013-10-15 16:02:09	StrawHatter	i dunno what time it shuts

2013-10-16 14:29:46	StrawHatter	Hamhut, do we have any tests in October? Or am I like, 40% high?
2013-10-16 14:29:57	StrawHatter	joe, I feel the same way so much, it isn't even funny..

2013-10-16 14:30:10	hamhut1066	I, don't we have an FP class test next monday?
2013-10-16 14:30:20	hamhut1066	maybe...
2013-10-16 14:30:38	hamhut1066	nothing mathsy. I have an Essay I need to write by the 30th of October
2013-10-16 14:31:17	hamhut1066	40% is a reasonable guess

2013-10-16 15:44:23	angusp	Panic over, StrawHatter is now in Appleton
2013-10-16 15:52:36	Jammy	127.0.0.1 is so 90s
2013-10-16 15:52:39	Jammy	I prefer ::1
2013-10-16 15:52:53	KitB	I prefer localhost
2013-10-16 15:53:00	Reid	\o/
2013-10-16 15:53:19	angusp	:Jammy I like how they've tried to force everyone to use ip v6 at least ten times now, but have settled on nat
2013-10-16 15:53:38	KitB	angusp: You shouldn't
2013-10-16 15:53:41	KitB	That should be a thing you hate
2013-10-16 15:53:48	KitB	Because we should really be using ipv6 by now
2013-10-16 15:53:49	Jammy	huh? nobody's forced anyone to use IPv6
2013-10-16 15:53:54	angusp	KitB: What, NAT?
2013-10-16 15:53:57	Jammy	that's *why* ISPs are mostly trying to NAT
2013-10-16 15:54:14	Jammy	because nobody is putting any pressure on them to IPv6 it up
2013-10-16 15:54:17	angusp	Jammy: I thing Google said the internet was full last year.
2013-10-16 15:54:25	angusp	think*
2013-10-16 15:54:32	 *	KitB sniggers
2013-10-16 15:54:35	Jammy	and saying the internet is full is putting pressure on?
2013-10-16 15:54:37	Jammy	nope
2013-10-16 15:54:55	Jammy	what *might* start making a difference is what's about to happen with Xbox One
2013-10-16 15:55:04	angusp	well it did make people freak out for about half a second.
2013-10-16 15:55:06	Jammy	I was watching a presentation about it, and they're doing 2 things
2013-10-16 15:55:13	hamhut1066	I think everyone should randomly start DDOS'ing eveyone else till the problem goes away
2013-10-16 15:55:26	angusp	LOIC FTW
2013-10-16 15:55:35	StrawHatter	I actually giggled like omg
2013-10-16 15:55:43	Jammy	firstly, they're speaking to ISPs directly about implementing IPv6, because the peer to peer connections on XB1 work better using it
2013-10-16 15:56:21	Jammy	and secondly, the troubleshooter (similar to the one in 360 which told you your NAT type) will mention that your connection is limited by the lack of IPv6, and you should contact your ISP
2013-10-16 15:56:40	Jammy	if other devices started doing similar things, *then* there would be pressure
2013-10-16 15:57:03	Jammy	why the hell would an ISP invest in rolling out v6 because some website is claiming that the internet is full?
2013-10-16 15:57:07	@drayshak	I watched the same talk, I don't hold a lot of faith in that particular department
2013-10-16 15:57:24	@drayshak	it pretty much boiled down to "we just choose whichever path ends up being fastest using *magic*" did it not?
2013-10-16 15:57:32	Jammy	they can cheaply do CG-NAT, so then the internet is no longer full
2013-10-16 15:57:48	Jammy	well, they said performance metrics, not magic, but sure
2013-10-16 15:57:54	Jammy	it's the same as what most browsers do
2013-10-16 15:58:09	Jammy	on the other hand, they are actually speaking to ISPs and things
2013-10-16 15:58:19	@drayshak	I guess I'm saying I'll believe it when I see it :D
2013-10-16 15:58:25	Jammy	to see an example of somehting similar working, just look at Netflix
2013-10-16 15:59:07	Jammy	by speaking directly to ISPs and releasing the monthly "average connection quality" ISP shame blog post, they've manager to get peering relationships with most major ISPs
2013-10-16 15:59:15	Jammy	and caching servers within the networks of many more
2013-10-16 15:59:35	Jammy	if you cause enough visability, customers start to understand the problem
2013-10-16 16:00:02	Jammy	the key is to make the potential loss of revenue from customers greater than the cost of implementing whatever it is you need to implement
2013-10-16 16:01:11	Jammy	they're not holding IPv6 back from you because they feel like being evil
2013-10-16 16:01:28	Jammy	it's just not rolling out because doing so would cost money, and there's very minimal demand
2013-10-16 16:01:36	Jammy	as soon as there's demand, there'll be rollout
2013-10-16 16:11:00	hamhut1066	in other news, it's just past 4!
2013-10-16 16:11:13	StrawHatter	W-woah... No way!
2013-10-16 16:22:10	StrawHatter	Anyone know a good Linux distro to introduce someone to it?
2013-10-16 16:23:44	Reid	Ubuntu is ezmodo
2013-10-16 16:24:48	Jammy	seconded
2013-10-16 16:24:56	Jammy	for noobs, nothing beats Ubuntu
2013-10-16 16:26:10	angusp	Saucy Salamander is tomorrow as well, not that anyone cares
2013-10-16 16:26:47	Norgg	Sourcy
2013-10-16 16:30:22	Fib	that reminds me I should install fedora
2013-10-16 16:32:56	hamhut1066	arch linux is the best
2013-10-16 16:33:41	StrawHatter	-tips-
2013-10-16 16:35:08	hamhut1066	be awesome
2013-10-16 16:35:11	hamhut1066	install linux
2013-10-16 16:38:28	Jammy	arch linux fucking sucks
2013-10-16 16:38:46	Jammy	I disageed with Kit about that once and I was wrong
2013-10-16 16:38:50	Jammy	it actually fucking sucks
2013-10-16 16:39:01	hamhut1066	what!!
2013-10-16 16:39:23	 *	angusp is making some popcorn
2013-10-16 16:39:56	hamhut1066	okay, maybe there is a little config involved in the beginning, what don't you like about it??
2013-10-16 16:40:33	Jammy	that once you've done the initial config in the beginning, you then have to overhaul all kinds of shit 3 months later when they change the networking system
2013-10-16 16:40:43	Jammy	and then 3 months later again when they change the init system
2013-10-16 16:40:48	 *	angusp is also donning teflon trousers
2013-10-16 16:40:49	Fib	arch linux: remember to pacman -syu everyday. HAH! you forgot to read the arch linux news page now all your shit is broken. Owned. Owned.
2013-10-16 16:41:01	Jammy	and then you'll get fed up of doing that, so you won't update for a week
2013-10-16 16:41:05	hamhut1066	Fib: +1
2013-10-16 16:41:18	hamhut1066	I can happily update once a week
2013-10-16 16:41:26	Jammy	and then libpacman or whatever it's called will update
2013-10-16 16:41:29	Jammy	and pacman won't
2013-10-16 16:41:38	hamhut1066	I was offline for 3 months, did an Syu and didn't blink twice
2013-10-16 16:41:44	Jammy	and then it will be all like, LIBPACMAN IS THE WRONG VERSION FOR THIS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
2013-10-16 16:42:11	Fib	also arch linux mave /usr/bin/python link to python3 asdfsadfasdf
2013-10-16 16:42:25	Fib	and then they did the SAME THING for ruby 1.9 or whatever
2013-10-16 16:42:38	Fib	they just break everything for no good reason
2013-10-16 16:42:40	Jammy	well it makes more sense for Ruby 1.9
2013-10-16 16:42:51	Jammy	that's usually backwards compatible
2013-10-16 16:42:56	Jammy	not many breaking changes up in there
2013-10-16 16:43:00	hamhut1066	okay, on that we can both agree, they change language every 20 minss
2013-10-16 16:43:01	Jammy	but Python 3 as the default?
2013-10-16 16:43:03	Jammy	oh god
2013-10-16 16:43:11	Fib	idk which version it was but it wasn't backwards compatible with the ruby things I wanted to run
2013-10-16 16:43:23	hamhut1066	then use rvm
2013-10-16 16:43:43	hamhut1066	or rbenv... people say it's a good idea
2013-10-16 16:43:51	Fib	I don't know ruby
2013-10-16 16:43:55	Fib	Or its tools
2013-10-16 16:44:12	hamhut1066	okay, it's kinda like the python virtualenv
2013-10-16 16:44:21	Fib	I was just running an open sores thing someone else made
2013-10-16 16:44:59	Fib	I should just run debian testing on my server
2013-10-16 16:45:10	Jammy	hamhut1066: If I ever get round to finishing it, you will like my STMU talk
2013-10-16 16:45:16	Jammy	it makes fun of Arch users
2013-10-16 16:45:46	hamhut1066	okay, do that! I'll be there to support it
2013-10-16 16:45:56	Fib	Arch is for people who would use gentoo but don't want long compile times to get in the way of the fun of fixing config files
2013-10-16 16:46:18	hamhut1066	what do you use then? I want something to shout at
2013-10-16 16:46:37	Jammy	at the time that I started working on this presentation? Arch
2013-10-16 16:46:46	Fib	Right now I use Ubuntu 12.04 because work, I'm not endorsing it though
2013-10-16 16:46:48	Jammy	and in fact, I still make fun of myself in it
2013-10-16 16:46:53	hamhut1066	also, what's not fun about changing config files?
2013-10-16 16:47:08	Fib	Some of us have other things to do with our lives
2013-10-16 16:47:09	Jammy	but anyone that uses Arch and doesn't make fun of themself for it has a serious mental health problem
2013-10-16 16:48:11	hamhut1066	I used arch linux after Ubuntu, it felt like I my computer was actually doing what I told it to
2013-10-16 16:48:30	hamhut1066	Ubuntu was a madman, randomly crashing, couldn't update properly
2013-10-16 16:48:31	Jammy	but you could have changed the config files in the same way on Ubuntu
2013-10-16 16:48:57	Jammy	essentially, you're just lazy and will only configure things to your liking when it's a choice between that or death
2013-10-16 16:49:56	angusp	Problem with Ubuntu is Unity is kinda patched onto GNOME and it's really easy to snafu an Ubuntu install by fiddling with ccsm too much.
2013-10-16 16:50:10	Fib	hamhut1066: I tried ubuntu like 4 times before trying arch and then ubuntu again
2013-10-16 16:50:27	angusp	Although imho unity is one of the best looking desktop environments
2013-10-16 16:50:52	Fib	I think Arch taught me valuable things, but that doesn't mean I want it to be my getting-work-done OS
2013-10-16 16:50:55	hamhut1066	I will agree that, if I tried Ubuntu, I  would have to immediately delete Unity and install a sane wm
2013-10-16 16:51:04	Fib	I use Gnome 3, I love it
2013-10-16 16:51:17	Fib	If only I could fix its notifications it would be perfect
2013-10-16 16:51:24	angusp	I liked how GNOME 2 was out of the way. 3 is a bit invasive
2013-10-16 16:51:34	hamhut1066	yeah, gnome 3 is pretty good. I use Xmonad with xfce as my DE
2013-10-16 16:51:48	hamhut1066	angusp: you suck
2013-10-16 16:52:04	 *	angusp just hit hamhut1066 irl
2013-10-16 16:52:20	 *	hamhut1066 wields bazooka
2013-10-16 16:52:28	angusp	shit
2013-10-16 16:52:34	Jammy	get a room you two
2013-10-16 16:52:50	angusp	dibs on AT 5.05
2013-10-16 16:53:29	Fib	I would love tiling wms if they did all the nice animating that moderns wms do
2013-10-16 16:53:57	Fib	Like, if you're going to shift a window around, would it kill you to animate that over 400ms or something
2013-10-16 16:54:17	hamhut1066	but think of those 400ms wasted!
2013-10-16 16:54:23	hamhut1066	jokes, maybe
2013-10-16 16:54:36	hamhut1066	I dunno, I like my windows to be organised
2013-10-16 16:54:59	hamhut1066	I get irritated with anything different (read less)
2013-10-16 16:56:09	Fib	I live and die by side-by-side windows, I don't know that I would get much use from anything more than that
2013-10-16 16:56:29	Fib	I can't stand OS X because the windows are all over the place and won't behave argh
2013-10-16 16:57:25	hamhut1066	agreed! Apparently you can get tiling with windows... I normally use Super+(right)
2013-10-16 16:57:29	edran	jammy is perfectly right. And I say as a user who has only used Linux in his life (E.g. started with Debian Woody about 11 years old) and that has used Arch for the past 5 years.
2013-10-16 16:57:35	<--	angusp (~pi@188.74.91.180) has quit (Quit: leaving)
2013-10-16 16:57:42	edran	As its main distro.
2013-10-16 16:57:46	edran	*his
2013-10-16 16:58:11	edran	The arch community has simply made some poor decisions.
2013-10-16 16:58:21	edran	And when I say community, I mean ~10 devs.
2013-10-16 16:58:23	-->	angusp (~pi@188.74.91.180) has joined #compsoc
2013-10-16 16:58:35	Jammy	I might try Gentoo
2013-10-16 16:58:38	hamhut1066	they're moving to git repos though
2013-10-16 16:58:43	Jammy	I've been playing with FreeBSD, and it's kinda fun
2013-10-16 16:59:59	edran	hamhut1066: that won't change anything. The problem doesn't lie within the tools.
2013-10-16 17:01:32	hamhut1066	yeah, was more of a random point of information... so do you still use init.d?
2013-10-16 17:11:24	edran	I migrated to systemd
2013-10-16 17:11:34	edran	Because I changed laptop
2013-10-16 17:11:44	edran	so I just decided to do it the Arch Way
2013-10-16 17:13:37	Jammy	the current Arch Way
2013-10-16 17:13:41	Jammy	give it a few months
2013-10-16 17:13:50	Jammy	they still haven't decided on Upstart
2013-10-16 17:14:13	Jammy	there's probably some obscure one we've never heard of that they can change to as well
2013-10-16 17:14:25	hamhut1066	but arch isn't really preaching stability
2013-10-16 17:15:13	hamhut1066	it looks for easy implementation and management of a system (long term)
2013-10-16 17:16:04	Jammy	hahahahaha
2013-10-16 17:16:08	Jammy	wat
2013-10-16 17:16:17	Jammy	easy implementation and management?
2013-10-16 17:16:19	Jammy	no
2013-10-16 17:16:21	Jammy	just no
2013-10-16 17:16:35	hamhut1066	yes, I have no idea how initd works! systemd is easy
2013-10-16 17:17:04	Jammy	are we talking about systemd here or Arch?
2013-10-16 17:17:09	hamhut1066	arch
2013-10-16 17:17:17	Jammy	oh, then my laughing at you still stands
2013-10-16 17:17:37	Jammy	Arch is a lot of things, but two things it definitely aren't are easy to implement and easy to manage
2013-10-16 17:18:00	hamhut1066	okay, my definition of easy, is that it will be logically setup
2013-10-16 17:18:03	Jammy	it's more about building understanding of your system and being minimal
2013-10-16 17:18:16	hamhut1066	global configs /etc personal configs ~/.*
2013-10-16 17:18:21	hamhut1066	easy peasy
2013-10-16 17:18:35	Jammy	they do seem to try and argue that by being minimal, and by understanding your system, it's easy as a side effect
2013-10-16 17:18:47	Jammy	but I think they're just trolling there
2013-10-16 17:18:50	Jammy	also, wat?
2013-10-16 17:19:13	Jammy	you're praising Arch for being easy because of a convention that most of the software in the repo uses?
2013-10-16 17:19:18	hamhut1066	okay, I can accept that, when I first arrived I had no idea how to drive my computer... now.
2013-10-16 17:19:20	-->	taobror (~taobror@5.63.147.100) has joined #compsoc
2013-10-16 17:19:24	Jammy	which is the same software in the repos of all of the other distros?
2013-10-16 17:19:36	angusp	something
2013-10-16 17:19:52	hamhut1066	ubuntu was weird.
2013-10-16 17:20:01	Jammy	in what way?
2013-10-16 17:20:02	hamhut1066	it made no sense
2013-10-16 17:20:22	Jammy	have you tried to configure it again since you've been using Arch?
2013-10-16 17:20:27	angusp	hamhut1066: It may be bag sided onto Gnome, full or weird hacks and odd stuff, but it's pretty
2013-10-16 17:20:27	hamhut1066	It would tell me I had updates then refuse to update when i asked it to
2013-10-16 17:20:35	Jammy	you just admitted that when you started using Arch, you had no idea how to use it
2013-10-16 17:20:48	hamhut1066	no, I'm being extremely biased
2013-10-16 17:21:12	angusp	Ubuntu does have the whole aptitude untrusted sources thingy going on...
2013-10-16 17:21:24	Jammy	the refusing to update thing... so that's like the problem I had with pacman? :P
2013-10-16 17:22:14	hamhut1066	haha, yes, but ubuntu gives us a pretty "press this button to update" then dies horribly.
2013-10-16 17:22:36	angusp	hamhut1066: You mean fails gracefully :p
2013-10-16 17:22:41	Jammy	so because the button doesn't work 1% of the time, it shouldn't be there the other 99%?
2013-10-16 17:23:07	Jammy	and if you don't want to use whatever the GUI tool is now, you can still use apt-get or aptitude
2013-10-16 17:23:31	hamhut1066	but I didn't know how to fix the aptitude key authentication problems... (dunno what they're called)
2013-10-16 17:23:43	angusp	aptitude doesn't like proxies and redirects at all.
2013-10-16 17:23:49	hamhut1066	also didn't know that was the problem till I nuked the drive with arch
2013-10-16 17:24:45	Jammy	use CentOS or Fedora or any of the other sane distros that don't use apt-get then
2013-10-16 17:24:59	angusp	Yum!
2013-10-16 17:25:20	hamhut1066	yeah, okay... so I used arch next because they had a good wiki and I had a friend who recommended it.
2013-10-16 17:25:32	hamhut1066	I also like that it's rolling release
2013-10-16 17:25:46	Jammy	that Arch wiki is awesome
2013-10-16 17:26:02	Jammy	and is mostly applicable to every other distro too
2013-10-16 17:26:18	<--	edran (~edran@cpat003.wlan.net.ed.ac.uk) has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2013-10-16 17:26:20	hamhut1066	yeah, it's a really good wiki... also arch uses almost vanilla packages
2013-10-16 17:26:26	hamhut1066	so that's awesome
2013-10-16 17:26:30	Jammy	once again, because most of the things you're giving Arch credit for are just well established norms in Linux
2013-10-16 17:26:40	angusp	And haskell-platform isn't in the current Ubuntu universe
2013-10-16 17:26:47	angusp	... although it will be tomorrow
2013-10-16 17:26:54	Jammy	the /etc for global config and ~/. for personal config thing...
2013-10-16 17:27:04	Jammy	did you really think that was Arch, or are you just trolling?
2013-10-16 17:27:08	hamhut1066	yeah, I know about that :p
2013-10-16 17:27:26	hamhut1066	it was my most nirvana moment
2013-10-16 17:27:32	Jammy	like, I'm pretty sure that's carried over from FUCKING UNIX
2013-10-16 17:27:42	hamhut1066	and it only happened after moving to arch...
2013-10-16 17:27:45	Jammy	so the fact that you're attributing it to Arch is hilarious
2013-10-16 17:27:50	angusp	Hay, UNIX isn't /that/ bad...
2013-10-16 17:28:00	Jammy	angusp: I didn't mean that as UNIX being bad
2013-10-16 17:28:15	Jammy	just that it's been a standard thing since WAY before Arch was even conceieved
2013-10-16 17:28:20	angusp	Jammy: just trolling
2013-10-16 17:28:23	Jammy	like, decades before
2013-10-16 17:28:27	hamhut1066	no, I know that config files are stored in general places
2013-10-16 17:28:29	StrawHatter	angusp, Hay is for horses dear...
2013-10-16 17:28:46	angusp	StrawHatter: Yeah, saw that. Thanks. Deer.
2013-10-16 17:28:49	hamhut1066	I attribute arch to teaching me that
2013-10-16 17:29:21	Jammy	so it sounds like you got to the point that the rest of us did, before Arch did something stupid again
2013-10-16 17:29:49	Jammy	I'll give it a year before you take your vastly improved Linux knowledge and switch to a less batshit insane distro
2013-10-16 17:30:05	Jammy	and guess what? all of your configuration will still work!
2013-10-16 17:31:34	hamhut1066	I'm sure they will, I have all my configs saved in a repo, was thinking of dual booting something else... but don't have a dislike of arch atm
2013-10-16 17:33:31	Jammy	I need to make some VMs tonight
2013-10-16 17:33:40	Jammy	one for a DNS server
2013-10-16 17:33:48	Jammy	and one for a replacement WiFi controller
2013-10-16 17:34:02	Jammy	the original WiFi controller has only been running since Sunday, but I broke it
2013-10-16 17:34:21	hamhut1066	use arch
2013-10-16 17:34:30	angusp	amhut1066: +1
2013-10-16 17:34:36	 *	StrawHatter DIES OF LAUGHTER
2013-10-16 17:34:50	angusp	... in AT 5.05 - awkward
2013-10-16 17:35:06	hamhut1066	not intended to spite, but it needed to be said :p
2013-10-16 17:36:51	Jammy	nah, gonna stick with Debian
2013-10-16 17:36:57	Jammy	Debian is pretty sweet for servers
2013-10-16 17:37:05	Jammy	considering CentOS for the DNS server
2013-10-16 17:37:32	hamhut1066	can't deny that. And I know nothing about CentOS. but could be fun
2013-10-16 17:39:40	Jammy	CentOS is... interesting
2013-10-16 17:40:00	Jammy	there's a severe lack of packages
2013-10-16 17:40:17	Jammy	but what is there seems to be really stable
2013-10-16 17:40:22	hamhut1066	hmm, who is their target market?
2013-10-16 17:40:46	Jammy	enterprise
2013-10-16 17:41:02	Jammy	people who would buy Red Hat, but don't want to pay for it
2013-10-16 17:41:13	hamhut1066	was just about to say that
2013-10-16 17:42:32	hamhut1066	isn't fedora the red hat pet project?
2013-10-16 17:43:20	Jammy	fedora is like the Red Hat testing ground
2013-10-16 17:43:39	angusp	I don't like debian much because it's kind of the proto distro - a lot of others are based off it.
2013-10-16 17:45:30	hamhut1066	I wouldn't know how stable it is, but it seems cool

2013-10-18 18:45:21	angusp	hamhut: As much as I love don, this method of screen scraping is realy resource intensive as you've got lists fill of shit in memory...
2013-10-18 18:45:37	angusp	hamhut: Tabs? since when has lynx had tabs?
2013-10-18 18:45:47	hamhut	I'm using dwb bitch!

2013-10-18 18:46:12	hamhut	I can actually render images... (I know links can too)
2013-10-18 18:46:16	angusp	everyone knows the best browser is mosaic
2013-10-18 18:46:44	hamhut	no, it's redirecting curl into a file, opening up the source then compiling a response using curl
2013-10-18 18:47:35	angusp	I can swap between the wonderful terminal and GNOME really easily, so I'm using chrome right now
2013-10-18 18:48:03	hamhut	are you using google-chrome or chromium?

2013-10-18 18:57:28	angusp	hamhut: Just looked at that. Now going to read it for an hour. brb
2013-10-18 18:58:53	hamhut	ok :p, did you figure out how to copy?
2013-10-18 18:59:02	hamhut	you can copy in screen
2013-10-18 18:59:16	angusp	hamhut: Yep, googled it.

2013-10-18 19:00:53	hamhut	or, use xmonad... you can get it to setup everything for you automatically!!!
2013-10-18 19:00:59	angusp	hamhut: Ubuntu isn't quite as stable as say.. SL or Arch...
2013-10-18 19:01:27	hamhut	arch isn't known for its stability (to ward off any flame wars)
2013-10-18 19:01:39	hamhut	but yeah, Ubuntu should be fine!
2013-10-18 19:01:46	hamhut	does it have memory leaks?
2013-10-18 19:02:56	angusp	hamhut: Nah, just occasional heisenbughs like X crashes, Unity hangs or tty deciding that bold text is a no-go today (got that one now :/). Having saidthat, just upgraded to 13.10 which seems more stable than 13.04
2013-10-18 19:05:20	angusp	*heisenbugs
2013-10-18 19:15:35	hamhut	that seems a bit off... isn't the *.10 series the 'beta'? or is it the 'better'
2013-10-18 19:18:11	angusp	hamhut: the name is year.month, with LTS versions every four releases, and the 04sare supposed to be more stabe but not in this case. Ubuntu betas and alphas are a great laugh - there's a heck of a lot of hindenbugs in there...
2013-10-18 19:20:25	hamhut	sounds like a whole bunch of fun!
2013-10-18 19:21:24	angusp	they're hilariously dangerous - can seriously snafu a system. Often woth a try in a VM

2013-10-18 19:30:19	Reid	Tron: Legacy benefits from 20 years more shinyness

2013-10-18 19:31:38	hamhut	what suggestion?

2013-10-20 01:32:44	@drayshak	so it turns out we have a little Minecraft modding community representing here, lol
2013-10-20 01:32:58	Sunstrike	Apparently so.
2013-10-20 01:37:40	edran	who?
2013-10-20 01:37:46	edran	you mean the channel?
2013-10-20 01:41:31	Sunstrike	Kinda. Turns out we were both obliviously sitting in the same channel on Esper as developers.
2013-10-20 01:43:48	@drayshak	yeah, Sunstrike and I represent two moderately popular things in the community
2013-10-20 01:44:01	@drayshak	I was watching a livestream and noticed him say Edinburgh, turns out we're on the same course haha
2013-10-20 01:44:16	Sunstrike	Albeit two years apart.
2013-10-20 01:44:34	Sunstrike	Kinda funny :p
2013-10-20 01:44:38	@drayshak	same year would have been a little too crazy :p
2013-10-20 01:44:43	Sunstrike	Oh yeah
2013-10-20 01:45:38	Reid	I dunno. Considering the usual levels of crazy in compsoc, I'd say par for the course.
2013-10-20 01:45:51	Sunstrike	True, true.
2013-10-20 01:46:03	Sunstrike	Also, when's/what's next social?
2013-10-20 01:48:10	edran	lol
2013-10-20 01:48:12	edran	good, good!
2013-10-20 01:48:23	edran	Would you guys up for some teaching sessions in CompSoc?
2013-10-20 01:48:38	edran	Having some modding session would be amazing :)
2013-10-20 01:48:40	Sunstrike	I'm always up for getting folk into Forge development.
2013-10-20 01:48:43	 *	Reid sleeps
2013-10-20 01:48:53	Sunstrike	Both in Java and Scala.
2013-10-20 01:49:03	@drayshak	I'd very much be a student in Forge development heh
2013-10-20 01:49:37	@drayshak	but something like that would be interesting, I'd certainly go along
2013-10-20 01:49:55	edran	okay
2013-10-20 01:50:05	edran	I'll add you guys to the compsoc committee group
2013-10-20 01:50:08	Sunstrike	I'd certainly be up for it with a smaller group; nothing too big as a trial. :p
2013-10-20 01:50:14	edran	Msg me on Fb, I'm Nantas
2013-10-20 01:50:18	edran	(The school rep :) )
2013-10-20 01:50:23	Sunstrike	Will toss a message your way then.
2013-10-20 01:50:27	edran	cheers!
2013-10-20 01:50:27	@drayshak	ahh Nantas right? I'm one of the 3rd year reps
2013-10-20 01:50:35	edran	ohahi!
2013-10-20 01:50:49	edran	I'm in AT right now but I'm heading home
2013-10-20 01:52:12	Sunstrike	Bah, Facederp. I've forgotten my password. xD

2013-10-20 11:15:56	StrawHatter	hamhut, you hyped for tomorrow?

2013-10-20 11:30:39	hamhut	what happens tomorrow?
2013-10-20 11:31:27	hamhut	KitB: it's something to do with Mod Dev, I think for minecraft. Will help me relearn the syntax of Java
2013-10-20 11:31:38	KitB_	Fair enough
2013-10-20 11:31:52	hamhut	also could be fun
2013-10-20 11:31:52	hamhut	;
2013-10-20 11:32:01	KitB_	Indeed
2013-10-20 11:32:29	hamhut	productive weekend?
2013-10-20 11:32:36	KitB_	Not yet

2013-10-20 11:33:22	KitB_	(but that doesn't really count as productivity)
2013-10-20 11:34:40	hamhut	okay, what inspired that? cisca being a pita?
2013-10-20 11:37:59	StrawHatter	hamhut, you know, that mini-test we have~
2013-10-20 11:40:11	hamhut	StrawHatter: yes, I'm familiar with it's approach
2013-10-20 11:44:44	hamhut	why do you ask
2013-10-20 11:45:11	StrawHatter	I-I was curious
2013-10-20 11:45:45	hamhut	how is windows8..2?
2013-10-20 11:49:10	StrawHatter	it's
2013-10-20 11:49:17	StrawHatter	pmuch the same
2013-10-20 11:49:23	StrawHatter	aside from a few things
2013-10-20 11:49:33	hamhut	any bsods?
2013-10-20 11:49:55	hamhut	or is it quite well behaved?
2013-10-20 11:50:17	StrawHatter	not yet <3 it's actually doing better than i though
2013-10-20 11:50:28	StrawHatter	thought* I thought it would have had a few panic attacks
2013-10-20 11:51:12	hamhut	good, well I can't say much, I installed xubuntu on my mini red laptop, with 3 other partitions for other things
2013-10-20 11:51:33	StrawHatter	your mini red laptop <3
2013-10-20 11:51:52	StrawHatter	it's so kyute
2013-10-20 11:52:10	hamhut	yep :P, I love it!!
2013-10-20 11:54:32	hamhut	dunno what else I'm gonna install on it yet. probs arch linux again, won't go rcazy and install gentoo though :p
2013-10-20 11:56:57	hamhut	okay, computer's low on battery, will be back with more power later

2013-10-20 13:00:25	hamhut	haha, okay, question about maths... anyone done the stuff for tonight?
2013-10-20 13:00:51	hamhut	can a subspace of  Rn be the whole of Rn?
2013-10-20 13:02:53	hamhut	or do I have the wrong idea of what a subspace is...
2013-10-20 13:03:08	Fib	I guess that would be a subspace but not a strict subspace
2013-10-20 13:04:29	hamhut	okay, from what I can gather of a subspace, it's kinda like the span of a set of vectors in R^n
2013-10-20 13:08:28	Fib	I think it's just a subset of a vector space that is also a vector space
2013-10-20 13:09:03	Fib	So in R^3 any plane is a subspace
2013-10-20 13:09:31	Fib	with a basis formed from any two non-parallel vectors
2013-10-20 13:09:34	Fib	in the plane
2013-10-20 13:09:34	StrawHatter	why in gods name would i do the maths for tonight?
2013-10-20 13:10:01	hamhut	StrawHatter: you're not being very helpful... go find a corner to cry in
2013-10-20 13:10:14	StrawHatter	hamhut, i'll probably do that in the haskell exam tomorrow qq
2013-10-20 13:11:06	hamhut	Fib: let's assume we are working in R^4, then would a subspace be in R^3?
2013-10-20 13:11:34	hamhut	StrawHatter, are you coming in tonight to do some practice?
2013-10-20 13:12:44	StrawHatter	hamhut, i can't </3
2013-10-20 13:13:05	hamhut	awww... how come??
2013-10-20 13:13:58	StrawHatter	because I don't stay in Edinburgh 
2013-10-20 13:17:48	hamhut	damn, but you have looked through some of the example tests?
2013-10-20 13:17:58	Fib	hamhut: well you could have a subset in R^2 or R^1 (or trivially in R^0) as well
2013-10-20 13:18:14	StrawHatter	hamhut, nope
2013-10-20 13:20:27	StrawHatter	was kinda hoping to do tutorial exercises 2-4 today and a bit of reading
2013-10-20 13:27:02	hamhut	Fib, okay, just got to that part in the book, just solved for a subset which turned out to be R^2
2013-10-20 13:46:34	StrawHatter	... It was in that moment... I remembered I also had to do maths... brb crying forever
2013-10-20 13:48:10	hamhut	okay dokes, remember to drink water, otherwise you'll dehydrate!
2013-10-20 13:50:33	StrawHatter	qq
2013-10-20 13:56:52	hamhut	have you done any haskell yet?
2013-10-20 13:57:03	hamhut	have you got it working on your computer yet?
2013-10-20 13:57:42	StrawHatter	i've done the first tutorial exercise
2013-10-20 13:57:46	StrawHatter	hue hue hue
2013-10-20 14:04:17	hamhut	well done... is that the 1st question in the 1st exercise or the whele thing?
2013-10-20 14:04:26	hamhut	in either case... good job
2013-10-20 14:06:05	StrawHatter	ohyou~ i'm just gonna quickly finish the second one then do the maths, then pokemon all day, erry day
2013-10-20 14:10:44	StrawHatter	so guys, question of the hour
2013-10-20 14:10:47	StrawHatter	tabs vs spaces
2013-10-20 14:19:11	Fib	Neither. Leave all your code unindented and ideally, minified.
2013-10-20 14:27:19	StrawHatter	i-i'm not that brave...

2013-10-20 14:43:35	Norgg	Actually normally 4 space tabs, unless convention in the language is different.
2013-10-20 14:44:11	Norgg	As in actual space characters.
2013-10-20 14:44:50	Norgg	Tab characters tend to cause sadness cross-editor.
2013-10-20 14:49:00	Norgg	There's pros/cons either way though so really it's a personal choice if you're working on your own.
2013-10-20 14:49:04	Norgg	If you're in a group you'll have to decide on a shared style by fighting with knives.
2013-10-20 14:53:40	Fib	The important thing is having a style and sticking to it more or less but not being crazy about it
2013-10-20 15:04:37	hamhut	I have my editor change tabs to 4 spaces... otherwise it can get irritating... tabs can cause randomness!

2013-10-20 15:44:03	edran	wtf
2013-10-20 15:44:06	hamhut	hmm, let me have a look
2013-10-20 15:44:30	hamhut	Linux hamhut-arch 3.11.5-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Oct 14 08:31:43 CEST 2013 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2013-10-20 15:45:12	angusp	hamhut: Just that the current stable version is 3.11.6
2013-10-20 15:45:33	edran	For Computer Science, yes. Linear Algebra is one of the basis of the theory of CS. For Software Engineering, not so much, but if you get into game development and math-heavy dev stuff, then you'll need it.
2013-10-20 15:45:38	hamhut	I'm not 100% sure, anything that goes wrong for me goes into journalctl

2013-10-20 15:51:01	 *	angusp secretly enjoys ILA (and can't remember how to spell today)
2013-10-20 15:51:30	hamhut	angusp: have you looked through the files in /var/log?
2013-10-20 15:51:51	hamhut	that's where pretty much all logs are stored
2013-10-20 15:52:33	angusp	hamhut: yep... just going there
2013-10-20 15:55:15	angusp	hamhut: I have a couple of warnings from Xorg about fonts... that might be it. Bold text doesn't work in tty :-(
2013-10-20 15:55:22	hamhut	found anything?
2013-10-20 15:55:50	hamhut	huh... there should be a boot log... am looking though my ubuntu one now. give me a sec
2013-10-20 15:56:15	angusp	The X log is full or warnings because of XMir, Unity, Ubuntu shit...
2013-10-20 15:56:26	angusp	oh, and nvidia, of course
2013-10-20 15:56:47	hamhut	maybe dmesg??
2013-10-20 15:57:11	hamhut	how far into the boot are you getting? have you got a tty?
2013-10-20 15:57:20	hamhut	and X is failing?
2013-10-20 15:59:41	angusp	hamhut: Nah, the boot is fine but some module somewhere is failing so that tyys don't have bold text support. Graphical session is fine and bold stuff works in that
2013-10-20 15:59:42	hamhut	I get my music player working! everything is ok
2013-10-20 16:00:01	hamhut	haha, so all you want is bold text :p
2013-10-20 16:00:13	hamhut	let me check on my laptop quickly
2013-10-20 16:00:30	angusp	not having bold is a pain in the backside
2013-10-20 16:01:02	angusp	i'm about 0.5 seconds into the boot log and there are a ton of module errors :-/
2013-10-20 16:01:36	hamhut	I don't have bold text either... change the font that you are using!
2013-10-20 16:01:44	hamhut	maybe that's the problem
2013-10-20 16:02:01	hamhut	I don't mind tbh... I just use a term that is fullscreen in my xsession

2013-10-20 16:02:41	angusp	man, the conf on this is shite. It's trying to load a ton of graphics modules, failing, then further down loading the intel grapics drivers and /then/ loads the graphics stuff, which now works. Numpties.
2013-10-20 16:03:08	hamhut	yeah I know... that's just how it works... I get the same thing with arch
2013-10-20 16:03:29	hamhut	It defaults back to nouveau drivers after not finding nvidia ones
2013-10-20 16:03:51	hamhut	and am too lazy to disable the search... too much effort for no reward...
2013-10-20 16:03:58	angusp	just saw intel hotswap drive module loaded... on a laptop. Why?!!
2013-10-20 16:05:31	hamhut	I have a solution!!!
2013-10-20 16:05:38	hamhut	compile your own kernel
2013-10-20 16:06:04	angusp	not whilst hunover. never. besides, it's fucking X not the kernel.
2013-10-20 16:07:11	hamhut	haha, but it's the kernel that does the searching i'm pretty sure... install wayland!!! gnome supports it!
2013-10-20 16:08:17	angusp	Wayland! Never!!!! XMir!!!!

2013-10-20 16:18:41	hamhut	yes, yes it is... I can't be bothered to remap my keyboard in tty... I just manually do it each time I log in
2013-10-20 16:18:49	hamhut	sudo loadkeys dvorak
2013-10-20 16:19:08	angusp	hamhut: there's someting wrong with you...
2013-10-20 16:21:04	angusp	just watching a talk by a wayland dev on why everyone is wrong
2013-10-20 16:22:18	hamhut	haha, and why is everyone wrong?
2013-10-20 16:22:54	StrawHatter	plot twist, he's wrong and everyone else is right
2013-10-20 16:23:19	angusp	he's taling about what X and wayland actually are, and why there's nothing bloaty about X, as most flamers think X is like GNOME
2013-10-20 16:23:33	hamhut	angusp: how is there something wrong with me? it's nice once you know how
2013-10-20 16:25:09	angusp	hamhut: Your linux install is so hipster that you dvorak on a qwerty :p
2013-10-20 16:28:02	hamhut	what would be the point of changing all the keys around on my keyboard? it would mean I would have to remember where all the qwerty keys are for installs and other random things
2013-10-20 16:28:12	angusp	true dat
2013-10-20 16:28:29	hamhut	I find it easier to type and I can *actually* touch type
2013-10-20 16:28:32	hamhut	:p
2013-10-20 16:31:56	angusp	this talk is pretty funny - the X dev is saying X was basically a baggy shite OS in it's own right with so many eatures it was painful.
2013-10-20 16:32:37	hamhut	so they made wayland?
2013-10-20 16:32:43	hamhut	I need to have a look at it!
2013-10-20 16:33:27	angusp	yeah. Apparently X has support for keyboards with buzzers in them for bells and embedded LCDs for messages and stuff - Why?!
2013-10-20 16:34:04	angusp	i mean it's cool, but they don't actually exist
2013-10-20 16:39:24	hamhut	haha, but they could!!! but I agree, I don't understand a large majority of X11, it's damn confusing... would be awesome to have an easier X server thingy
2013-10-20 16:39:36	hamhut	am looking at Mir now
2013-10-20 16:40:10	angusp	wayland basically shfts most of the rendering to the WM
2013-10-20 16:43:56	hamhut	am looking at Mir, it's pretty cool... if they implement it like they plan to it could be really good... may even mean that we can have good rendering on linux :p
2013-10-20 16:44:02	hamhut	possibly gaming level!!!
2013-10-20 16:44:08	hamhut	maybe I'm pushing it
2013-10-20 16:44:35	angusp	oh yeah, then someonel like valve may actually recognise the platform - oh wait, they just did.

2013-10-20 16:52:13	angusp	In X, mice have a 32 bit theoretical maximum number of buttons on them. Stupid.

2013-10-20 22:39:17	StrawHatter	i can't into maths
2013-10-20 22:39:42	Reid	I dunno the rest of the data you've got for that question ^_^
2013-10-20 22:39:55	Reid	But x+2z=0, y=0 sounds like it's in R cubed
2013-10-20 22:42:56	angusp	Reid: That's what I thought. second question was about a vector being in col(matrix) for an unknown value k in it. Think I got that right.
2013-10-20 22:43:20	hamhut	angusp: yeah... not sure what happened... my computer stopped responding
2013-10-20 22:43:33	hamhut	angusp: haven't looked into the logs though
2013-10-20 22:43:34	angusp	StrawHatter: Tempted to put "Really hard to do with a hangover; suggest posting reading tests on stale nights" in the feedback
2013-10-20 22:43:46	angusp	hamhut: Fixed my font fuckup
2013-10-20 22:43:55	hamhut	what was wrong?
2013-10-20 22:44:38	angusp	hamhut: Trying to load nonexistent fonts from /usr/somesubdirectory.
2013-10-20 22:45:02	hamhut	how did you solve it?
2013-10-20 22:45:06	hamhut	what did you change?
2013-10-20 22:46:29	StrawHatter	guys, what's a column vector?
2013-10-20 22:46:42	angusp	it's in console-config, which is somewher I can't remember
2013-10-20 22:46:51	StrawHatter	no but really, column space?
2013-10-20 22:47:29	StrawHatter	fug, i need pen and paper </3
2013-10-20 22:47:53	angusp	column space gave me a headache
2013-10-20 22:48:04	angusp	correction: worse headache
2013-10-20 22:48:08	Reid	Column vector is one written vertically, aka sanely.
2013-10-20 22:48:16	Reid	Technically a 1 x n matrix
2013-10-20 22:48:22	StrawHatter	i
2013-10-20 22:48:32	StrawHatter	actually forgot i had a TI calculator for a moment
2013-10-20 22:48:40	Sunstrike	I like to think of it as taking an array of numbers… And writing it in a column.
2013-10-20 22:49:00	angusp	hamhut: /etc/default/console-setup in ub
2013-10-20 22:49:29	Reid	Sunstrike: That's pretty much what it is
2013-10-20 22:49:41	Reid	It has the advantage of obeying all the matrix rules though for transformations
2013-10-20 22:50:02	Reid	But essentially, it's an array in vertical format
2013-10-20 22:52:21	Sunstrike	Yeah. Because I don't have a mathy background so much, that's an easy way for me to grasp it.
2013-10-20 22:52:36	angusp	Reid: Is the cross product a commutative and associative operation? Just if it was then vectors would be an abelian group whilst matricies aren't, i.e. AB != BA, but does vector a x vector b === b x a
2013-10-20 22:53:58	Reid	Cross is anticommutative
2013-10-20 22:54:09	Reid	(a x b = -b x a)
2013-10-20 22:54:31	Reid	And it's not associative.
2013-10-20 22:54:53	Reid	Satisfies the Jacobi identity though
2013-10-20 22:55:09	angusp	Reid: I guess that means vectors are matricies ish but not quite :p
2013-10-20 22:55:28	Reid	They're 1 x n matrices
2013-10-20 22:56:00	StrawHatter	if i'm getting a huge value for an unknown, that probably means i did bad right?
2013-10-20 22:56:19	Reid	Also, you can't take a cross product of matrices ;) Only works for vectors.
2013-10-20 22:56:36	angusp	StrwHatter: Most likeley. But TI ain't got notingon Casio, soit might be that :p
2013-10-20 22:56:42	Reid	Normal to the plane containing both vectors.
2013-10-20 22:56:59	Reid	StrawHatter: Ignore angusp, TI 4 lyfe. It probably means a mistake somewhere
2013-10-20 22:57:05	angusp	Reid: Yeah, special property of 1xn and mx1 matricies :)
2013-10-20 22:57:15	Reid	If you're using cross product, check you're in radians :D
2013-10-20 22:57:25	Reid	angusp: Exactly.
2013-10-20 22:57:49	angusp	Reid: FYI we had a race between my Casio and his TI in ILA (bored, of course) and the casio won.
2013-10-20 22:58:17	angusp	but TIs do have the whole awesome thing of being able to do every question on a maths paper

2013-10-20 23:07:05	cronin101	a column vector 3 high is 3x1
2013-10-20 23:07:08	cronin101	not 1x3
2013-10-20 23:07:20	cronin101	nxm -> n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns
2013-10-20 23:08:33	Reid	...right you are.
2013-10-20 23:08:50	Reid	I blame alcohol.
2013-10-20 23:09:15	@StarScream	i blame alcohol for everything

2013-10-20 23:10:07	cronin101	also to be even more nitpicky, a x b = -(b x a)
2013-10-20 23:10:10	@StarScream	just get your mates to buy you some
2013-10-20 23:10:21	cronin101	But otherwise fine :p

2013-10-20 23:11:13	StrawHatter	i wish i was top tier at maths qq
2013-10-20 23:13:01	cronin101	It only depends on how much work you put in really
2013-10-20 23:13:10	Reid	cronin101: I think *technically* -b x a also works, doesn't it?
2013-10-20 23:13:17	cronin101	if you find something interesting and bother to learn it you can be 'top-tier'
2013-10-20 23:13:26	Reid	Although -(b x a) is a better phrasing
2013-10-20 23:15:03	cronin101	So it does ._.
2013-10-20 23:17:02	hamhut	ok, cool

2013-10-22 13:38:13	angusp	Jammy: It runs linux, using Intel's architecture calles idk what, but they're trying to compete with ARM. The power is in being able to use Arduino IO functions in the same piece of code as linux system calls and stuff, so basically it's c++ and Linux as opposed to Pyton and Linux (mainly) on a RPi
2013-10-22 13:38:20	angusp	plus it looks cool
2013-10-22 13:38:40	Jammy	oh!
2013-10-22 13:38:47	Jammy	I didn't realise it actually ran Linux
2013-10-22 13:39:27	Jammy	I kinda flicked through the page about it on the Arduino website and got the impression it was just a standard arduino with a 400MHz Pentium processor
2013-10-22 13:42:05	angusp	I'm pretty sure it runs linux; seen references to calling linux functions in ino code. Having a pentium on an arduino would be as overkill as a powerpc in a stannah stairlift
2013-10-22 13:43:56	angusp	Oh wait - there is a powerpc in a stannah stairlift

2013-10-22 13:47:17	Jammy	that won't mean you get one :P

2013-10-22 13:50:12	angusp	Actually, I take that back. Just looked up the freescale tower board and it's pcb porn
2013-10-22 13:50:57	Jammy	they are pretty cool
2013-10-22 13:51:41	Jammy	although they're loaded with kernels without the timer included
2013-10-22 13:51:56	angusp	so disappointed /r/pcbporn doesn't exist. I'll have to stick to /r/cableporn
2013-10-22 13:52:02	Jammy	I asked the TA if I could rebuild the kernel with the timer included, and he said to just put a sleep in instead
2013-10-22 13:52:03	angusp	Jammy: Dat's dumb
2013-10-22 13:52:04	Jammy	wat

2013-10-22 15:34:18	hamhut	yeah, who needs an X server
2013-10-22 15:35:22	hamhut	angusp: I'm considering moving to ubuntu, just so I can use steam 'properly' :p maybe the graphics drivers will work better in the Ubuntuverse
2013-10-22 15:37:24	hamhut	angusp: I installed xubuntu on my netbook and had about 30 mins trying to figure out why my X server wasn't starting and why I couldn't just startx :p
2013-10-22 15:38:07	angusp	mmmmm... still fall back on ope source drivers if it's nvidia
2013-10-22 15:38:47	angusp	often startx doesn't work in *buntu, you need sudo lightdm or sudo gdm, something like that as it's weird
2013-10-22 15:39:24	@amazoph	lol, X. I've gone through several attempts of trying to update the graphics driver on my nettop, I think it has some frankenstein combination of Debian-packaged Nvidia drivers and the direct from Nvidia version.
2013-10-22 15:39:41	@amazoph	thinking that nuking from orbit and starting over may be the only way to clean this mess
2013-10-22 15:40:06	@amazoph	fortunanely i don't use the graphical enviroment that much on it...
2013-10-22 15:40:53	@amazoph	tl;dr: open source driver good, 3rd party packaged one bad.
2013-10-22 15:43:12	hamhut	amazoph: yeah os drivers work really well on my laptops... but rendering a flash video is about as far as I get before my computer decides it's had enough and stops
2013-10-22 15:43:52	hamhut	amazorph: I use the os drivers because the prop. ones crash my computer... and I'm too lazy to figure it out
2013-10-22 15:44:43	@amazoph	haha, yeah. there's just so much that can go wrong, I got fed up of trying to fix it every time it updated
2013-10-22 15:45:18	@amazoph	hopefully with the advent of the steambox things will get better in the future

2013-10-22 15:47:13	@amazoph	not much but rumours and speculation just now, I think.
2013-10-22 15:47:25	@amazoph	probably going to be a fork of a major known distro

2013-10-22 15:50:01	hamhut	more procrastination material, perfect :p
2013-10-22 15:50:10	Fib	Valve already have a package manager, it's called "Steam"
2013-10-22 15:50:36	Fib	Apps and games will just be huge binary blobs with everything compiled in
2013-10-22 15:50:57	Fib	Running on a kernel with weird patches linus won't allow in mainline
2013-10-22 15:51:50	Fib	Also the steam controller is bad!!
2013-10-22 15:54:30	hamhut	Fib: yeah, then it will need a general package manager for security patches and such... Will it maintain its own flavour of linux? I suppose people will create repos for it though
2013-10-22 15:54:47	hamhut	if it's open source, then cool things can happen
2013-10-22 15:55:12	@amazoph	it's already been said that steamos will be modifiable by the user
2013-10-22 15:55:43	@amazoph	so i wouldn't be surprised if people add in support for a seperate package manager for linux software
2013-10-22 15:57:53	Fib	irl I expect it'll be about as "open" as android is

2013-10-22 17:30:03	angusp	hamhut: Was thinking about getting the free upgrade to Win8, but thought I'd rather not have to fix my master boot record
2013-10-22 17:30:06	hamhut	what? sounds fun... having a look now
2013-10-22 17:30:24	hamhut	angusp: do you need to do crazy things to install win 8?
2013-10-22 17:30:49	hamhut	I'm still using the mbr on my main laptop... moved to gpt on my netbook though

2013-10-22 17:31:39	angusp	other than that, not much. Just I have a weird HDD setup and UEFI boot hack
2013-10-22 17:32:12	Jammy	I like Win 8
2013-10-22 17:32:27	Jammy	still undecided about 8.1 though
2013-10-22 17:32:39	Jammy	there's a stupid button in the bottom left that wastes space
2013-10-22 17:32:41	hamhut	is there actuallya difference between the 2?
2013-10-22 17:32:44	Jammy	hopefully I can turn it off
2013-10-22 17:32:54	hamhut	that would be irritating! I hate wasted space
2013-10-22 17:33:03	angusp	Jammy: Win8 looks nice but whoever did the UX needs to be shot
2013-10-22 17:33:08	Jammy	also, it currently has a thing in the bottom right going "SECURE BOOT IS NOT CONFIGURED CORRECTLY"
2013-10-22 17:33:15	Jammy	angusp: Why?
2013-10-22 17:33:28	Jammy	I always like asking this
2013-10-22 17:33:34	Jammy	the answer is usually just "it's different"
2013-10-22 17:33:42	Jammy	or "it's designed for tablets"
2013-10-22 17:33:48	Jammy	the latter of which is just wrong
2013-10-22 17:33:52	angusp	Jammy: The shutdown button is in the options menu. Not logical. But metro is pretty
2013-10-22 17:34:07	Jammy	Fitt's law, mofo
2013-10-22 17:34:11	@drayshak	I like Windows 8 but Metro is a deeply unpleasant experience
2013-10-22 17:34:16	@drayshak	so I grab Start8 and I'm done
2013-10-22 17:34:34	hamhut	I tried it in a vm last year around may-june... it kinda irritated me because I couldnt ram my mouse into any of the corners
2013-10-22 17:34:39	Sunstrike	Windows 8 is nice and fast… but you have to ignore Metro except as an app launcher :P
2013-10-22 17:34:42	angusp	metro is a bit pointless - on a large screen, the IE9 back button is about the size of a football
2013-10-22 17:34:56	Jammy	oh, that's another thing I dislike about 8.1
2013-10-22 17:35:00	Jammy	THEY RUINED THE SEARCH
2013-10-22 17:35:05	@drayshak	Sunstrike: stealing fullscreen just to launch something is a fucking terrible idea, heh
2013-10-22 17:35:09	Jammy	Windows 8 search was perfection
2013-10-22 17:35:21	hamhut	yeah, win 7 search was good too
2013-10-22 17:35:22	angusp	Jammy: 7, you mean
2013-10-22 17:35:23	Sunstrike	It -is- terrible drayshak but… It's the closest I get to Spotlight on Winderps
2013-10-22 17:35:31	hamhut	as long as you let it run wild on your computer
2013-10-22 17:35:33	@drayshak	Jammy: you mean enhanced it by passing your search information to trusted Microsoft partners? :)
2013-10-22 17:35:36	StrawHatter	From what i've seen so far, Windows 8 and 8.1 have like, a few differences
2013-10-22 17:35:41	Jammy	start typing, tab a bit to decide what you want to search (Files, Setting, Apps etc)
2013-10-22 17:35:48	angusp	hamhut: did you say you had UEFI secure boot issues?
2013-10-22 17:35:55	Jammy	and then the results are all there, all easily accessible with no scrolling at all
2013-10-22 17:36:00	StrawHatter	Atleast you can boot straight to desktop now
2013-10-22 17:36:13	hamhut	angusp: nope, Isn't that the problem with new windows  8 pre-installs...
2013-10-22 17:36:15	angusp	StrawHatter: Hence even Micro$oft won't charge for the upgrade
2013-10-22 17:36:18	Jammy	now, it's gone to just occupying the right edge of the screen
2013-10-22 17:36:20	hamhut	and does win 8 need this?
2013-10-22 17:36:24	Jammy	and I have to scroll again
2013-10-22 17:36:24	angusp	hamhut: Yep.
2013-10-22 17:36:37	Jammy	and it takes like... an extra couple of seconds to do things
2013-10-22 17:36:38	@drayshak	oh god not the $ symbols
2013-10-22 17:36:47	Jammy	you also can't directly tab between search scopes now
2013-10-22 17:36:49	hamhut	you need to scroll around the desktop?? that's so annoying
2013-10-22 17:36:51	StrawHatter	am i a bad person for liking it? :c
2013-10-22 17:37:00	angusp	hamhut: Win8 doesn't /need/ secure boot but comes with it by default to pissoff dual booters
2013-10-22 17:37:25	hamhut	ah, well played microsoft
2013-10-22 17:38:00	angusp	drayshak: $$$$$$$$$$
2013-10-22 17:38:04	hamhut	StrawHatter: nope, it's a nice looking os methinks... I just don't want to learn a new os..
2013-10-22 17:38:08	Jammy	hamhut: What do you mean by scrolling around the desktop?
2013-10-22 17:38:44	hamhut	the metro thing, don't you kinda need (easier to use) the scrollwheel? also it scrolls sideways!!
2013-10-22 17:38:51	hamhut	with the down scroll
2013-10-22 17:38:57	angusp	WIn8 is still noticeably slower than a tidy linux install on the same machine
2013-10-22 17:39:10	hamhut	angusp: install slitaz!!
2013-10-22 17:39:21	Jammy	Well it depends on how you use it I guess
2013-10-22 17:39:24	@drayshak	angusp: how do you even quantify that?
2013-10-22 17:39:41	Jammy	Win 7: Either open apps by searching, or open by scrolling through start menu to find app
2013-10-22 17:39:56	Jammy	Win 8: Either open apps by searching, or open by scrolling through start screen to find app
2013-10-22 17:40:01	angusp	hamhut: That's the definition of a tidy Linux install :p
2013-10-22 17:40:13	hamhut	tidy != clean
2013-10-22 17:40:22	Jammy	unless it's in the little taskbar thing at the bottom
2013-10-22 17:40:30	Jammy	in which case 7 and 8 act identically
2013-10-22 17:40:56	angusp	drayshak: No idea. Just messing.
2013-10-22 17:40:58	hamhut	Jammy: okay... I heard tell that they had decided to move around and hide some of the config settings
2013-10-22 17:41:12	StrawHatter	so guys
2013-10-22 17:41:18	StrawHatter	who we voting for year rep?
2013-10-22 17:41:19	Jammy	you mean the stuff in control panel?
2013-10-22 17:41:29	Jammy	I get the feeling that's being slowly deprecated
2013-10-22 17:41:39	hamhut	angusp: I think that linux is more capable of running on low spec computers
2013-10-22 17:41:40	Jammy	some settings moved into a new Settings app in Win 8
2013-10-22 17:41:45	Jammy	mmore of them have moved in 8.1
2013-10-22 17:42:22	angusp	hamhut: Well, yeah. You try and get a NT kernel to run on a RPi.
2013-10-22 17:42:22	hamhut	Jammy: okay, I can live with that... are they trying to move to a more central config area for the whole computer?
2013-10-22 17:42:47	Jammy	well, they're trying to standardise how to get to it
2013-10-22 17:43:03	Jammy	it's not like on iOS Windows Phone where you go to settings and you have settings for all of your apps
2013-10-22 17:43:32	Jammy	but, whichever app you're in (if it's "modern" UI), you open the charm bar, click settings, and the settings are there
2013-10-22 17:43:48	hamhut	Jammy: that would be nice. do you know if they are trying to get devs to use a global settings area? or is that the reg?
2013-10-22 17:43:59	hamhut	does windows still have that?
2013-10-22 17:44:21	Jammy	registry is still there, but I imagine it isn't used in "modern" apps
2013-10-22 17:44:34	Jammy	I haven't dont much W8 development, so I'm not sure
2013-10-22 17:44:49	Jammy	WP8 keeps settings in a database thing within the app sandbox
2013-10-22 17:45:14	angusp	Love the subliminal meaning of "I haven't don't much Win8 dev..."
2013-10-22 17:46:02	hamhut	okay, that's pretty cool. so they're trying tot make things easier for devs... but they'll still use their own config files (I'm thinking games here)
2013-10-22 17:46:09	hamhut	s/tot/to
2013-10-22 17:46:16	StrawHatter	angusp, go try out for year rep for CompSoc so hamhut has some competition
2013-10-22 17:46:41	hamhut	StrawHatter: what!! I have competition! just look!
2013-10-22 17:46:49	hamhut	there are at least 2 other people
2013-10-22 17:46:52	angusp	StrwaHatter: Nice try
2013-10-22 17:46:56	StrawHatter	not serious competition though <3
2013-10-22 17:47:37	hamhut	what? I'm sure they stand a chance!
2013-10-22 17:47:51	StrawHatter	hamhut, you're far too modest dear. 
2013-10-22 17:47:54	hamhut	also, they'll have some beautifully prepared statement for friday
2013-10-22 17:48:05	hamhut	I'm planning on winging it!
2013-10-22 17:48:08	angusp	the final competition to see who will be year rep will be as follows:
2013-10-22 17:48:12	hamhut	but at least I have a plan
2013-10-22 17:48:32	angusp	type a tar command to extract a tar.bz2 first try, no man-ing
2013-10-22 17:48:34	StrawHatter	say you go on irc. you should pretty much just auto win
2013-10-22 17:48:56	Jammy	angusp: just extract?
2013-10-22 17:49:04	Jammy	are we preserving permissions or not?
2013-10-22 17:49:12	hamhut	tar -xzvf aouth.bz2
2013-10-22 17:49:15	hamhut	is that close?
2013-10-22 17:49:16	Jammy	would you like to see the filenames fly past as they get extracted
2013-10-22 17:49:23	Jammy	hamhut: I think change the z for a j
2013-10-22 17:49:31	Jammy	IIRC
2013-10-22 17:49:34	angusp	hamhut: Jammy wins. Sorry.
2013-10-22 17:49:41	hamhut	Jammy: damn, it's an impossible task
2013-10-22 17:49:54	hamhut	did you man?
2013-10-22 17:49:59	hamhut	:p
2013-10-22 17:50:32	angusp	hamhut: no one can man that fast... unless you're an amazing grepper
2013-10-22 17:50:51	Jammy	tar is pretty easy to learn
2013-10-22 17:51:12	Jammy	the j option you're less likely to remember though
2013-10-22 17:51:25	Jammy	because who ever uses .bz2
2013-10-22 17:51:29	hamhut	yeah, -xvf normally just works
2013-10-22 17:51:34	hamhut	(tm)
2013-10-22 17:51:45	angusp	Jammy: easy for the common types, a bit harder for the stupid ones like bz2
2013-10-22 17:52:04	hamhut	I think I've used bz2 maybe once...
2013-10-22 17:52:30	angusp	tar -xvfz does a tar.gz. I think it is j for a bz2
2013-10-22 17:53:05	StrawHatter	you guys done the CL tutorial work?
2013-10-22 17:53:06	hamhut	yeah, but tar normally autoresolves what algorithm to use
2013-10-22 17:53:08	Jammy	my standard options are -xzpf
2013-10-22 17:53:28	Jammy	extract a gzip file while preserving permissions
2013-10-22 17:53:50	angusp	can tar do .rar? That's possibly the worst one to come across
2013-10-22 17:53:59	hamhut	-p is a good one... I should start using that one... tbh my most untarred is my PKGBUILDS, permissions aren't too important
2013-10-22 17:54:13	hamhut	angusp: naa, theres unrar for that
2013-10-22 17:54:23	angusp	hamhut: not standard
2013-10-22 17:54:24	Jammy	sometimes, it the tar contains lots of files, I like to chuck a v in there too
2013-10-22 17:54:33	Jammy	so the filenames all fly past and I look like a hacker
2013-10-22 17:54:37	Jammy	hax hax hax
2013-10-22 17:55:07	hamhut	definitely the way to do it!, what if someone is looking over your shoulder?
2013-10-22 17:55:08	angusp	Jammy: I oftern verbose stuff so it looks like I'm actually doing something
2013-10-22 17:55:58	hamhut	is anyone going to this thing outside bar 50 at some point tonight?
2013-10-22 17:56:12	angusp	hamhut: what thing?
2013-10-22 17:56:24	Jammy	oooh, I might
2013-10-22 17:56:27	Jammy	although I might be late
2013-10-22 17:56:47	angusp	StrawHatter: Ish. Just went through it, wasn't too bad
2013-10-22 17:57:22	hamhut	angusp: people are celebrating the success of our test yesterday! also it's compsoc social night
2013-10-22 17:57:33	StrawHatter	angusp, it looks super boring
2013-10-22 17:57:45	angusp	hamhut: May go, but I'm not drinking for a week.
2013-10-22 17:57:51	hamhut	I can't be there too long! I need to write an essay
2013-10-22 17:58:26	Jammy	who knows what a fibre channel is?
2013-10-22 17:58:30	Jammy	are they interesting?
2013-10-22 17:58:33	hamhut	it kinda sucks but somehow I've managed to line-up several social events in a row... also.
2013-10-22 17:58:50	hamhut	is that one of the x channels that runs on a single fibre line?
2013-10-22 17:58:57	hamhut	i think 40
2013-10-22 17:59:05	StrawHatter	oh yeah
2013-10-22 17:59:12	StrawHatter	guess who's getting councelling session sorted <3
2013-10-22 17:59:16	angusp	Jammy: Interesting, yes, and flipping fast
2013-10-22 17:59:37	hamhut	Jammy: could actually do research... was laying fibre cables in Nairobi... it was pretty awesome
2013-10-22 17:59:57	Jammy	hmmm, looks like it only does 16Gb/s at the moment
2013-10-22 17:59:59	Jammy	not that fast
2013-10-22 18:00:48	angusp	Jammy: I think you just combine multiple channels for more speed. It's 16 Gb/s for 1 optical fibre
2013-10-22 18:00:49	hamhut	the ones of the coast of Africa do about 40Tb/s per fibre
2013-10-22 18:00:59	hamhut	off*
2013-10-22 18:01:19	hamhut	and you can use one fibre for multiple signals
2013-10-22 18:01:51	angusp	hamhut: That's some multiplexing. Almost as good as my 3 exabit ber second download yesterday :p
2013-10-22 18:02:22	Jammy	angusp: I don't think you're talking fibre channel here :P
2013-10-22 18:02:22	hamhut	angusp: yeah, the best I've seen is a 40Tb flash drive
2013-10-22 18:02:29	Jammy	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_channel
2013-10-22 18:02:30	lambdabot	Title: Fibre Channel - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
2013-10-22 18:02:35	 *	hamhut heads home
2013-10-22 18:02:37	hamhut	brb
2013-10-22 18:03:59	Jammy	you're more likely to be using something like SONET for long distance things
2013-10-22 18:04:13	Jammy	fibre channel seems to be mostly for SAN and studd
2013-10-22 18:04:15	Jammy	stuff*
2013-10-22 18:04:25	angusp	I think the thing I'm thinking of is fibre channel... Usually for large ass inter-building intranets
2013-10-22 18:05:00	angusp	Jammy: SCSI over fibre channel is cool...
2013-10-22 18:09:08	Jammy	also, do inter-building links really use fibre channel?
2013-10-22 18:09:12	Jammy	I never realised
2013-10-22 18:09:26	Jammy	what's the reason for doing that over just ethernet?
2013-10-22 18:09:51	angusp	Where I worked for a bit we had fibre optic stuff going from the servers to the switches in the 5 or so different buildings
2013-10-22 18:10:14	angusp	Copper cabling is more expensive, drops voltage and is slower
2013-10-22 18:10:33	Jammy	fibre != fibre channel
2013-10-22 18:11:09	Jammy	are you sure they weren't using ethernet over fibre?
2013-10-22 18:11:31	angusp	Jammy: Never did much with the fibre stuff. I guessed fibre channel was just one protocol for it.
2013-10-22 18:12:09	Jammy	I guess this is kinda answering my question about if I should learn about this or not :P
2013-10-22 18:12:32	Jammy	picking up service provider routing should be relatively simple on my own
2013-10-22 18:12:35	Jammy	but this stuff?
2013-10-22 18:12:38	angusp	the fibre stuff at work went through some proprietary Ethernet -> Fibre converters, no idea what protocol it uses
2013-10-22 18:12:59	angusp	Jammy: All the lower level (TCP...) internet stuff is awesome
2013-10-22 18:14:12	Jammy	pffft
2013-10-22 18:14:24	angusp	want to try and get unique IPs for all the stuff on my router in my room as it's NATing at the moment. May be hard.
2013-10-22 18:14:28	Jammy	TCP isn't lower level internet!
2013-10-22 18:15:06	Jammy	and you mean publically routable unique IPs?
2013-10-22 18:15:22	Jammy	your best bet would be to switch to a business broadband provider
2013-10-22 18:15:29	Jammy	or someone like A&A
2013-10-22 18:16:06	Jammy	when Be got absorbed into o2, the major providers offering multiple IPv4s seemed to disappear
2013-10-22 18:16:44	angusp	Jammy: TCP... Minor brain fart. ARP is low level. TCP is lower than application layer though...
2013-10-22 18:17:33	angusp	And the router is on KeyCom, just it's annoying trying to run servers on multiple machines without setting porr forwarding.
2013-10-22 18:17:42	angusp	port*
2013-10-22 18:18:58	Jammy	man, do Keycom even give each room a single IP still?
2013-10-22 18:19:13	Jammy	I honestly thought they'd have sold all of their IP addresses except 5 by now
2013-10-22 18:19:26	angusp	No idea. Probably NATting like crazy
2013-10-22 18:19:47	angusp	can't be bothered to check packets to see how badly
2013-10-22 18:19:52	hamhut	Jammy: I have a unique ip
2013-10-22 18:20:11	angusp	hamhut: Nah, that's just what they're telling you :p
2013-10-22 18:20:24	Jammy	yeah, are you *sure* about that? :P
2013-10-22 18:20:47	hamhut	angusp: fine, it's dynamically assigned, but at least I have one and am not hidden behind a proxy
2013-10-22 18:21:03	hamhut	I've had the same ip now for about 3 weeks
2013-10-22 18:21:27	hamhut	just checked
2013-10-22 18:22:22	angusp	I have a static but it's for the router. I hate how most ISPs are fussy about static IPs
2013-10-22 18:22:54	Jammy	can we pls just give up on IPv4 already?
2013-10-22 18:22:57	Jammy	IT'S DEAD
2013-10-22 18:22:59	Jammy	LET IT DIE
2013-10-22 18:23:15	Sunstrike	My ISP refuse to upgrade >.>
2013-10-22 18:23:29	angusp	Yeah, but :::0:18:fe:1a:0 doesn't have the same ring to it as 22.212.16.4
2013-10-22 18:23:44	angusp	(disclaimer: just made both of those up)
2013-10-22 18:23:58	Sunstrike	But there is no place like ::1
2013-10-22 18:24:04	StrawHatter	no but, they both sound kyute
2013-10-22 18:24:31	angusp	now ::1 is much better than typing 127.0.0.1
2013-10-22 18:25:03	Sunstrike	That ::1 shortcut is awesome for trolling idiots in Minecraft streams. They all know "127.0.0.1" by now; none of them know ::1.
2013-10-22 18:26:04	angusp	NAT is'nt exactly an elegant hack, and you can't expect most people to be able to change to ipv6 easily, so it's the ISPs responsibility
2013-10-22 18:26:37	Jammy	angusp: your example IPv6 address would be invalid :P
2013-10-22 18:27:08	angusp	Jammy: Most likeley :D
2013-10-22 18:28:06	hamhut	fail
2013-10-22 18:28:15	Jammy	but yeah, the idea is that you'd just use DNS for everything
2013-10-22 18:28:41	angusp	Jammy: It'd be a bit hard to exchange IPs at a big lan party otherwise
2013-10-22 18:29:06	Jammy	use neighbour discovery!
2013-10-22 18:29:39	Jammy	exchanging IPs at LANs is so 1990
2013-10-22 18:30:07	Jammy	so is manually configuring your IP address or using DHCP
2013-10-22 18:30:14	Jammy	SLAAC is where it's at
2013-10-22 18:30:28	hamhut	do expand
2013-10-22 18:30:47	angusp	what were we even playong over lan in 1990? (I say we, but mean old people because I was -4)
2013-10-22 18:31:08	hamhut	zork!
2013-10-22 18:31:08	angusp	hamhut: d  o    e  x  p  a  n  d
2013-10-22 18:31:34	hamhut	angusp: I'm not even going to dignify that with an answer
2013-10-22 18:31:46	angusp	ha ha
2013-10-22 18:32:13	Jammy	hamhut: expand on the SLAAC thing?
2013-10-22 18:32:48	StrawHatter	angusp, did you really just say you were -4? 
2013-10-22 18:32:54	hamhut	Jammy: yeah, is it a new protocol?
2013-10-22 18:33:01	Jammy	SLAAC is really fucking cool
2013-10-22 18:33:06	Jammy	it's part of IPv6
2013-10-22 18:33:17	angusp	StrawHatter: in 1990, yes
2013-10-22 18:33:27	Jammy	so basically
2013-10-22 18:33:32	hamhut	is it serverless?
2013-10-22 18:34:23	Jammy	every IPv6 enabled interface has a link local address
2013-10-22 18:34:33	Jammy	you can see yours right now, you almost definitely have them
2013-10-22 18:35:13	Jammy	these are local to a link, so when you first connect, you assign yourself a link local address and then broadcast something like "YO! ANY ROUTERS IN THE HOUSE?"
2013-10-22 18:36:36	StrawHatter	guise
2013-10-22 18:36:43	StrawHatter	what's an STMU?
2013-10-22 18:36:48	hamhut	oh, cool, I see my local link with ifconfig...
2013-10-22 18:36:49	angusp	And all the routers be like: YO! SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY USING IPV6! HELP!
2013-10-22 18:37:52	Jammy	routers receiving this respond with "YO! I'M A ROUTER! I AM 2001:470::abcd:efab:cdef AND YOU LIVE IN 2001:470::/64
2013-10-22 18:38:21	Jammy	so now, you know that your IP address starts with 2001:470::
2013-10-22 18:38:27	hamhut	Jammp: sounds good, what are the chances of conflicting ipv6? (not statistically, but are they assigned like MAC addresses?)
2013-10-22 18:38:49	Jammy	or, put in full, 2001:0470:0000:0000
2013-10-22 18:39:08	Jammy	the bottom half of the address is then derived from the MAC address of the interface
2013-10-22 18:39:20	angusp	Are the IPv6 and IPv4 spaces completely isolated from eachother on the same router? is there any crossover?
2013-10-22 18:39:49	Jammy	completely isolated
2013-10-22 18:39:59	Jammy	one is 32 bits long and the other is 128 bits
2013-10-22 18:40:01	@drayshak	it still blows my mind that my VPS company can just give me a /64 block
2013-10-22 18:40:12	Jammy	drayshak: everyone gets a /64!
2013-10-22 18:40:22	angusp	StrawHatter: No idea what but I'm going :D
2013-10-22 18:40:44	Jammy	EUI-64 (the thing used to work out the bottom half of the address in SLAAC) needs a /64
2013-10-22 18:41:16	Jammy	HE will give you a /48 for your tunnel if you ask
2013-10-22 18:41:25	Jammy	for that IPv6 subnetting goodness
2013-10-22 18:41:38	Jammy	seeing as subnets can't be smaller than /64
2013-10-22 18:44:32	StrawHatter	phew, i can come along on friday <3
2013-10-22 18:44:43	hamhut	StrawHatter: for the egm?
2013-10-22 18:46:37	StrawHatter	yeah :P
2013-10-22 18:48:03	StrawHatter	oh gosh, i just found my old pace stick <333
2013-10-22 18:50:24	hamhut	your pace stick?
2013-10-22 18:51:32	StrawHatter	yeah, for doing drill with
2013-10-22 18:51:36	angusp	Anyone else get really annoyed that disowning screen doesn't save regions?
2013-10-22 18:53:29	hamhut	what?? are you talking about GNU/screen?
2013-10-22 18:54:21	angusp	hamhut: Yes. The console thing. I have the perfect setup for it but manually do it each time I start screen, and I don't think there's an option for that in .screenrc
2013-10-22 18:54:47	hamhut	hmmm, have you trawled the man pageL

2013-10-22 19:21:32	angusp	like, the online man doesn't even seem to have the C-a | listed in it.
2013-10-22 19:22:13	angusp	I got columns it's aresome for 1 big workspace and another split horizontally with ghci and weechat :D
2013-10-22 19:22:40	angusp	kinda this shape: [  |--]
2013-10-22 19:23:52	hamhut	haha, yeah, but apparently not in all releases of screen...just change config to 'split -v'
2013-10-22 19:23:58	hamhut	but I assume you found that?

2013-10-22 19:26:51	angusp	No idea what happened to grammar there...
2013-10-22 19:27:39	angusp	just trying it out... brb
2013-10-22 19:28:09	hamhut	okay, Imma gonna try tmux... see if I can get it to be awesome!
2013-10-22 19:28:22	angusp	nope, no change.
2013-10-22 19:29:26	hamhut	I think you need to string lots of splits and floats together
2013-10-22 19:30:20	angusp	got it! win!
2013-10-22 19:30:29	hamhut	well done!!
2013-10-22 19:30:56	angusp	split -v; focus; split; focus; resize +5; focus; resize +5
2013-10-22 19:31:05	angusp	all new lines of course.
2013-10-22 19:33:51	hamhut	haha, seems nice and clean :p
2013-10-22 19:34:15	hamhut	am looking through the tmux config to see if I can decipher it :p
2013-10-22 19:34:23	angusp	hamhut: Yeah, and I was also fiddling with the themeing ish
2013-10-22 19:35:23	hamhut	you can set a theme with screen?
2013-10-22 19:35:24	angusp	isn't tmux basically the same thing as screen? (Don't know it that well)
2013-10-22 19:35:43	hamhut	yep, but slightly different... I can't vsplit with screen
2013-10-22 19:35:49	hamhut	so am trying tmux
2013-10-22 19:36:05	angusp	hamhut: Loosely speaking. Custom colours on region borders and permanent strings at the bottom
2013-10-22 19:36:59	hamhut	haha, why would you want permanent strings? I want mine to tell me what's going on in my term
2013-10-22 19:38:19	StrawHatter	hamhut, i don't have the force though...
2013-10-22 19:38:36	angusp	hamhut: Persistent is a better word, like hostname, time, window list...
2013-10-22 19:38:44	angusp	like shell profiles
2013-10-22 19:39:11	hamhut	ah, okay, fair enough... tmux does that automatically... try installing it and have a look
2013-10-22 19:41:08	angusp	looks a lot like screen... why is the less known one always the one with the more/better features?
2013-10-22 19:41:39	hamhut	haha, it's the way things are... :p
2013-10-22 19:43:27	angusp	hamhut: Linux. Fuck logic
2013-10-22 19:45:10	angusp	you'll have to excuse me, I'm straving so I'm going to go eat.

2013-10-25 12:13:04	Sunstrike	Why why why can't there be an OS X 10.9 package…
2013-10-25 12:13:25	Sunstrike	Hm… Seems it's missing the required module data to build against 10.9
2013-10-25 12:19:39	Sunstrike	Can't even transition safely to Arla; they last supported OS X 10.4...
2013-10-25 12:22:12	Sunstrike	And… No sysname for Mavericks too. Greaaaat.
2013-10-25 12:22:24	Sunstrike	AFS is hosed. :p

2013-10-25 12:23:44	Sunstrike	I want to be able to grab my Informatics drive
2013-10-25 12:23:51	Jammy	if you put your files in the cloud, you can get them from anywhere in the world
2013-10-25 12:23:57	Jammy	through the power of the cloud
2013-10-25 12:24:13	Sunstrike	I just like having access to it. I don't strictly need it.

2013-10-25 12:47:17	Sunstrike	Could do but that's iffy on OS X

2013-10-27 23:50:51	KitB	Not necessarily for the course
2013-10-27 23:51:02	KitB	But for the rest of the courses you rarely need more than matrix multiplication
2013-10-27 23:51:16	StrawHatter	that sounds like a major pain, i'm not even lying
2013-10-27 23:51:17	angusp	KitB: Hey, the optional content for tut3 was the inverse of a matrix... that's hard enough by hand
2013-10-27 23:51:34	KitB	also entirely optional
2013-10-27 23:51:54	angusp	optional = nerd credit / trying to beat hamhut]
2013-10-27 23:52:22	ball-hayden	Toby Bailey is great in comparison to the two that taught CAP last year
2013-10-27 23:52:26	hamhut	what...? I don't think I'm gonna do the optional this week... I have so many things to do
2013-10-27 23:52:32	ball-hayden	Beware CAP... it's not fun
2013-10-27 23:53:50	angusp	Calculus sucks, and there's no way of getting around that fact... btw did you see that Malyatrax sampled don: http://www.house-mixes.com/profile/malyatrax/play/functprogdon
2013-10-27 23:53:50	lambdabot	Title: FuncTProgDon by Malyatrax (Tech House Mix), http://tinyurl.com/p3ouvwj
2013-10-27 23:54:42	ball-hayden	That's great
2013-10-27 23:56:03	hamhut	is this the one that you guys showed me ealier? angusp
2013-10-27 23:56:42	angusp	hamhut: Yep.
2013-10-27 23:57:42	angusp	KitB How many racks/blades are we talking for this tardis thingy? Is the large-ass generator outside AT for that as well?
2013-10-27 23:57:54	hamhut	cool, also, now that I have your attention, pls look at inf1... I have a question about fp
2013-10-27 23:58:19	KitB	angusp: ask ball-hayden 
2013-10-27 23:58:40	ball-hayden	https://www.dropbox.com/s/nuf4tdf2bq972wd/TARDIS.jpg
2013-10-27 23:58:55	ball-hayden	Things have moved a bit, but that's the lot
2013-10-28 00:00:01	ball-hayden	No idea what the generator is for
2013-10-28 00:00:06	ball-hayden	I'd quite like to know too
2013-10-28 00:00:30	@amazoph	slightly less boxen than i remember
2013-10-28 00:00:32	angusp	ball-hayden: Might be whole building backup power?
2013-10-28 00:00:49	ball-hayden	Could be... but wouldn't have thought that would be a temporary unit.
2013-10-28 00:01:20	angusp	There's spare rackspace.. You can borrow my poweredge for a couple of years if you buy me new SCSIs
2013-10-28 00:01:43	angusp	ball-hayden: Those generators can be semi-permanent
2013-10-28 00:02:03	ball-hayden	We also need disks
2013-10-28 00:02:07	ball-hayden	*lots
2013-10-28 00:02:45	angusp	Yeah... Mine occasionally flashes at me with a prefail drive warning for at least one drive.
2013-10-28 00:03:13	angusp	Most of the hardware there looks like Sun stuff? Is it mainly Linux or Solaris?
2013-10-28 00:03:24	 *	amazoph 's poweredge blew up last week during a Debian install...
2013-10-28 00:03:35	@amazoph	supposed RAM failure :(
2013-10-28 00:04:02	@amazoph	still have to swap sticks and see if it's the modules or the backplane that's faulty
2013-10-28 00:04:28	angusp	amazoph: Ouch. Which one? Mine's getting along a lot, being a PowerEdge 2650
2013-10-28 00:04:48	@amazoph	PE 1950, got it a few months ago and upgraded it
2013-10-28 00:04:57	angusp	and where is charlotte (student.compute) because she's beautiful
2013-10-28 00:05:40	@amazoph	no idea, i expect in AT or the IF server room.
2013-10-28 00:06:25	angusp	Charlotte must be a fairly new machine as her cpuinfo is impressive
2013-10-28 00:07:19	KitB	Careful personifying charlotte
2013-10-28 00:07:41	KitB	I was using Jenkins CI during SDP
2013-10-28 00:07:50	KitB	and I needed a compute server to run builds from it
2013-10-28 00:08:12	KitB	As a result I have written a commit message that reads "Make Jenkins use Charlotte as a slave"
2013-10-28 00:08:33	hamhut	lol
2013-10-28 00:08:37	angusp	Yeah, the pe 2650 is 2004 so actually the same age as facebook, which I guess is old now :(]
2013-10-28 00:09:07	angusp	KitB: We personify charlotte semi-deliberately. Man, she must have a huge rack.
2013-10-28 00:09:18	KitB	You guys.
2013-10-28 00:09:34	angusp	KitB: Goddamn 1st years
2013-10-28 00:10:07	KitB	No nono
2013-10-28 00:10:09	KitB	I mean
2013-10-28 00:10:14	KitB	You guys. :)
2013-10-28 00:10:32	ball-hayden	You have jenkins running on computer?
2013-10-28 00:10:32	KitB	As in
2013-10-28 00:10:34	ball-hayden	*compute?
2013-10-28 00:10:38	KitB	You guys will fit in just fine
2013-10-28 00:10:41	KitB	Had
2013-10-28 00:10:47	ball-hayden	:-(
2013-10-28 00:10:53	ball-hayden	This should be an informatics service
2013-10-28 00:11:07	KitB	I didn't actually run jenkins on compute as a server
2013-10-28 00:11:16	KitB	I ran it on AWS
2013-10-28 00:11:25	angusp	Whoever names Charlotte is either a genius with his mind in the gutter, or lonely.
2013-10-28 00:12:04	@StarScream	wizard was my favourite
2013-10-28 00:12:19	KitB	Seriously?
2013-10-28 00:12:28	@StarScream	I liked the name
2013-10-28 00:12:29	KitB	Do you even know about ceilingcat?
2013-10-28 00:12:39	ball-hayden	KitB beat me to it
2013-10-28 00:12:41	@StarScream	what
2013-10-28 00:12:48	KitB	D:
2013-10-28 00:12:49	ball-hayden	West Lab
2013-10-28 00:12:58	angusp	yes, but charlotte has the whole issue with needing very careful wording when redering to stuff like finger and bash and stuff..
2013-10-28 00:12:58	ball-hayden	Nearest the back staircase
2013-10-28 00:13:05	KitB	underneath the ceilingcat
2013-10-28 00:13:09	@StarScream	:o no
2013-10-28 00:13:23	angusp	Did someone get so bored that they gave all the dice machines names, some of which are hilarious
2013-10-28 00:13:34	ball-hayden	All the dice machines have names
2013-10-28 00:13:40	@StarScream	all the dice machines have names for reasons
2013-10-28 00:13:43	ball-hayden	You can see it on the login screen (bottom right)
2013-10-28 00:13:51	@StarScream	aw man if I had known about ceilingcat
2013-10-28 00:13:55	KitB	Also on the yellow sticker on the front of the machine
2013-10-28 00:14:12	angusp	Yeah, noticed all of them. Can you ssh directly to them?
2013-10-28 00:14:15	ball-hayden	yep
2013-10-28 00:14:23	ball-hayden	from the gateway
2013-10-28 00:14:32	KitB	so not directly
2013-10-28 00:14:36	ball-hayden	Well...
2013-10-28 00:14:37	ball-hayden	close
2013-10-28 00:14:47	@amazoph	...huh. what came first, the ceiling cat pic in AT5 or the workstation?
2013-10-28 00:14:55	KitB	The pic
2013-10-28 00:14:58	angusp	errr... kubelik?
2013-10-28 00:15:01	ball-hayden	Yep
2013-10-28 00:15:03	@amazoph	:D
2013-10-28 00:15:06	KitB	ceilingcat was named that a couple of years ago
2013-10-28 00:15:07	@StarScream	yeah my money was on the pic
2013-10-28 00:15:18	KitB	I can remember it appearing
2013-10-28 00:15:36	ball-hayden	KitB is old.
2013-10-28 00:15:39	ball-hayden	:-P
2013-10-28 00:15:54	KitB	Get off my lawn!
2013-10-28 00:15:57	@StarScream	hah
2013-10-28 00:16:50	angusp	someone's maxing out one of charlotte's cores in matlab at the moment
2013-10-28 00:17:11	KitB	Someone's *always* maxing out some of charlotte's cores in matlab
2013-10-28 00:18:16	angusp	KitB: And some 1st year is running some java process that is (of course) eating memory fater than emacs
2013-10-28 00:20:23	ball-hayden	KILL IT
2013-10-28 00:20:29	ball-hayden	KILL IT WITH FIRE
2013-10-28 00:21:31	angusp	Yeah, and a matlab process that's been going on for 2 days? What do you even need to compute that much???
2013-10-28 00:21:43	KitB	You'd be surprised.
2013-10-28 00:21:43	angusp	ball-hayden: KILL IT WITH -9s!
2013-10-28 00:22:12	angusp	does matlab not even do multi core shite>
2013-10-28 00:22:37	KitB	Actually matlab does automatic clustering
2013-10-28 00:22:51	KitB	Any machines that have matlab open can be co-opted into performing computations for other machines
2013-10-28 00:24:09	angusp	KitB: That's nifty
2013-10-28 00:24:17	KitB	angusp: Sort of
2013-10-28 00:24:55	angusp	I love how when the RPi came out people thought that it could be used for mini supercomputers
2013-10-28 00:25:15	angusp	but no, the ethernet works through usb, so it's slow as shit
2013-10-28 00:25:25	 *	angusp was so upset
2013-10-28 00:25:59	StrawHatter	what
2013-10-28 00:26:01	StrawHatter	did i miss?
2013-10-28 00:26:37	angusp	StrawHatter: Servers and shit
2013-10-28 00:30:11	StrawHatter	anugsp: Ohhhh, sounds neat
2013-10-28 00:31:41	angusp	yeah. Anyways, it's got so late it's now early so I'm going to sleep for a bit until IM.

2013-10-28 11:02:35	angusp	Sunstrike: Hello
2013-10-28 11:02:59	Sunstrike	Going through the FSM stuff in the lecture slides… It's much easier without a lecturer yammering and rushing
2013-10-28 11:03:56	KitB	Sunstrike: What's the lecturer called again?
2013-10-28 11:03:56	angusp	Yeah, when you look at it fsm are really simple
2013-10-28 11:04:02	Sunstrike	Rahul
2013-10-28 11:04:07	StrawHatter	Rahul <3
2013-10-28 11:04:08	Sunstrike	…I think that's how it's spelt?
2013-10-28 11:04:12	KitB	And yes, FSMs are really simple
2013-10-28 11:04:24	Sunstrike	Meh. Anyway. I'm flicking through the slides. It's actually pretty cool
2013-10-28 11:04:48	angusp	Yeah. I don't know how long he's been lecturing but I kinda get the impression that he's quite nervous about it
2013-10-28 11:05:34	StrawHatter	I'm sure that this is his first time lecturing CL. This is what I've heard anyway. 
2013-10-28 11:06:15	KitB	It is
2013-10-28 11:07:18	StrawHatter	Maybe he just isn't used to lecturing yet? I mean, you can tell he knows his stuff.. But he can't really explain it very well..
2013-10-28 11:07:37	Sunstrike	Yeah, that's what I think it is
2013-10-28 11:07:46	Sunstrike	But he only ends up confusing me more, so I self-teach it
2013-10-28 11:08:13	KitB	The tutorials are probably your most useful resource
2013-10-28 11:08:18	Reid	^
2013-10-28 11:08:22	Sunstrike	Aye
2013-10-28 11:08:25	Reid	Even if you skip lectures, go to tutorials
2013-10-28 11:08:30	Sunstrike	Always.
2013-10-28 11:08:40	StrawHatter	I kinda do the opposite
2013-10-28 11:08:48	angusp	Yeah, CL tutorials are great. Usually just ask about any outstanding issues and Areti (my tutor) goes over them fine.
2013-10-28 11:08:52	Sunstrike	I find the tutorials infinitely more useful
2013-10-28 11:08:56	KitB	Good.
2013-10-28 11:09:00	KitB	tutorials generally are
2013-10-28 11:09:26	Sunstrike	Lectures and tutorials balance out for me when it comes to FP
2013-10-28 11:09:29	StrawHatter	I tried to go to mine last Wednesday. But I forgot what room it was and I had a mini-panic attack so I just kinda didn't go
2013-10-28 11:10:30	angusp	Sunstrike: I think in FP tutorials can be less useful if people are just writing up their solutions; It's quite hard to get someone else's code and there can be lots of ways of doing something
2013-10-28 11:11:08	Sunstrike	Yeah. It's also quite slow because some tutors insist on doing all the writing. But my tutor is pretty good about it despite that; goes through and explains how the program flows
2013-10-28 11:11:34	angusp	Yeah, solutions need to be abstracted a bit from just code
2013-10-28 11:12:02	Sunstrike	Yeah
2013-10-28 11:12:42	angusp	Like, my tutor asked me to go over my pp function from tut4, ended up just explaining what it does as the board wasn't big enough
2013-10-28 11:12:45	Sunstrike	Not very much documentation of the "Something/Something" notation here… Is it "input/output"?
2013-10-28 11:13:23	StrawHatter	Comments in Haskell are just "--" right?
2013-10-28 11:13:28	Sunstrike	Aye
2013-10-28 11:13:33	StrawHatter	Cheers
2013-10-28 11:14:33	angusp	and multiline are {-  -} instead of /* */
2013-10-28 11:14:47	Sunstrike	Haskell has weird comment syntax x)
2013-10-28 11:14:56	Sunstrike	I quite like my // and /* */
2013-10-28 11:15:13	StrawHatter	Right, last question. Is there any point in doing guards on a single line instead of multi-lining them?
2013-10-28 11:15:34	Sunstrike	Nah; multi-line is just neater isn't it? I think…
2013-10-28 11:16:40	StrawHatter	Awesome, cheers.
2013-10-28 11:17:09	Sunstrike	Haskell cares not for your whitespace if I recall… Unlike Python. Tab-hell!
2013-10-28 11:17:58	angusp	I drop my guards down immediately, but some like to do them inline with the top 
2013-10-28 11:18:11	angusp	fun a b | bsbs = jaja
2013-10-28 11:18:22	angusp	         | stuff = sss
2013-10-28 11:18:38	Sunstrike	I generally do "funcName a b | guard  = stuff" then the next line has the pipe lining up, and line up all the =
2013-10-28 11:18:59	Sunstrike	With two spaces between the guard and = atleast
2013-10-28 11:19:11	StrawHatter	How much harder to the tutorial exercises get? 
2013-10-28 11:19:17	angusp	I like to drop mine, i.e.
2013-10-28 11:19:17	Sunstrike	It's weird, but I was finding myself getting my various "=" commands mixed up…
2013-10-28 11:19:20	angusp	fun a b
2013-10-28 11:19:24	angusp	  | s =stuff
2013-10-28 11:19:30	angusp	  | etc
2013-10-28 11:19:32	Sunstrike	Perfectly valid
2013-10-28 11:19:50	Sunstrike	I'm doing the FSM stuff now, will worry about FP after tomorrows lecture.
2013-10-28 11:19:53	angusp	just saves a bit of space if it'sa long guard
2013-10-28 11:20:11	Sunstrike	I have a wide terminal; line length hasn't been a problem thus far. :p
2013-10-28 11:20:18	angusp	Yeah, the next fp lecture looks a bit intensive with all the ADT stuff
2013-10-28 11:20:22	Sunstrike	Fun fun
2013-10-28 11:21:02	angusp	I /do/ have a wide terminal but often vsplit it with screen so Ican have emacs, weechat and ghci visible
2013-10-28 11:21:32	Sunstrike	I use iTerm 2 so I have the Visor window as Vim, then jump to a ghci terminal one layer lower
2013-10-28 11:21:42	Sunstrike	And IRC sits next to the GHCi window.
2013-10-28 11:22:51	angusp	Yeah, guess that's similar
2013-10-28 11:23:06	Sunstrike	I also refuse to touch Emacs except to play Tetris.
2013-10-28 11:23:55	angusp	If you don't know EMACS or VIM, they're as bad as eachother in terms of non-intuitave keybindings
2013-10-28 11:24:02	Sunstrike	Mhm
2013-10-28 11:24:11	angusp	But I'm now using emacs to annoy hamhut
2013-10-28 11:24:17	Sunstrike	As said before; Emacs is a great OS. Shame about it's text editor.
2013-10-28 11:24:40	angusp	EMACS is even a better os than X
2013-10-28 11:25:32	Reid	I dunno. Vim pretends to make occasional sense.
2013-10-28 11:25:38	Sunstrike	As in OS X or X11? :P
2013-10-28 11:25:47	Reid	:q quits, :w writes...that makes sense.
2013-10-28 11:25:51	angusp	X11
2013-10-28 11:25:52	Reid	Ish
2013-10-28 11:25:55	Sunstrike	And :wq writes AND quits
2013-10-28 11:25:59	Reid	In that order
2013-10-28 11:26:03	Sunstrike	yup
2013-10-28 11:26:07	Sunstrike	It makes some sense.
2013-10-28 11:26:18	Reid	r to replace a character, R to keep replacing
2013-10-28 11:26:20	angusp	Yeah, but foor a noob you open either and you're like "How the fuck do I kill this thing?"
2013-10-28 11:26:26	Reid	Not so much
2013-10-28 11:26:38	Reid	vim you do ctrl-c and ZE DAY EEZ SAVED
2013-10-28 11:26:48	angusp	I think a couple of years ago X11 was so bag-sided it could do basic kernel stuff
2013-10-28 11:26:51	Reid	Emacs pretends to make sense
2013-10-28 11:26:53	Sunstrike	Tbh first time I used Emacs I always killed it with closing the terminal window… x3
2013-10-28 11:27:02	Reid	Pretends being the operative word
2013-10-28 11:27:13	Reid	That key combo that in every other program ever does this? Nah. Not here.
2013-10-28 11:27:18	Sunstrike	I'm sad we don't get Vim plugins for Haskell during exams
2013-10-28 11:27:26	Reid	geidt
2013-10-28 11:27:30	Reid	gedit*
2013-10-28 11:27:37	Sunstrike	But then I have to use GEdit.
2013-10-28 11:27:43	Sunstrike	And that's a horrible fate :p
2013-10-28 11:27:50	Reid	Nah
2013-10-28 11:27:56	Sunstrike	I'll probably suffer on with Vim + A second window for GHCI
2013-10-28 11:28:09	Fib	You get computers during exams? In my day we had exams that asked us to write a Java Quine and all we had was pen and paper! And we liked it! #wedidntlikeit
2013-10-28 11:28:09	Reid	gedit is a simple text editor, with no operating system capabilities
2013-10-28 11:28:10	angusp	Reid: I don't actually like emacs that much, but I can get by using it and haskell mode is a help
2013-10-28 11:28:27	Sunstrike	Eh, I can use Vim as a basic editor too
2013-10-28 11:28:31	Sunstrike	Even without my vimrc
2013-10-28 11:28:36	angusp	does gedit have a non graphical option?
2013-10-28 11:28:37	StrawHatter	S-So am I the only one who likes Notepad++?
2013-10-28 11:28:41	Reid	angusp: Iirc, KitB wrote a great little thing for gedit to add a ghci window.
2013-10-28 11:28:47	Sunstrike	Gedit is a Gnome editor so no :p
2013-10-28 11:28:59	Reid	Y'know it has non-gnome options, right?
2013-10-28 11:29:04	Reid	Heck, it runs on Windows
2013-10-28 11:29:06	Sunstrike	Asides; I like having my GHCi and editor sessions seperate
2013-10-28 11:29:18	 *	Reid goes with vim for little edits, gedit for moderate edits
2013-10-28 11:29:50	Sunstrike	I stick with Vim in general. Now I have all my plugins, why would I switch to a GUI editor?
2013-10-28 11:29:56	Sunstrike	It even accepts mouse input :p
2013-10-28 11:29:58	angusp	gedit's syntax highlighting and non-auto indentation has always pissed me off
2013-10-28 11:30:46	Reid	You can turn on auto-indentation in options with a checkbox?
2013-10-28 11:30:57	Reid	And tell it not to highlight syntax
2013-10-28 11:31:01	Reid	Defaults do not make things bad!
2013-10-28 11:31:19	Reid	Sunstrike: I never got round to mouse-input vim plugins. But so would if I was using it more.
2013-10-28 11:31:28	Sunstrike	You don't need a plugin
2013-10-28 11:31:34	Sunstrike	It's in core; you just need to enable it
2013-10-28 11:31:43	angusp	what's a checkbox? is that some kind of config file :p
2013-10-28 11:31:51	KitB	angusp: Behave ;)
2013-10-28 11:32:00	angusp	KitB: Sorry
2013-10-28 11:32:07	Sunstrike	Love config files; hate PLists.
2013-10-28 11:32:19	Sunstrike	The reality of Mac living
2013-10-28 11:32:26	angusp	Sunstrike: dont' get me started on plists. Especially in osx
2013-10-28 11:32:43	Sunstrike	XML configs are a brilliant idea. ./end-sarcasm
2013-10-28 11:32:50	angusp	I am 99% of the way to wiping lion off my mac and bungung Ubuntu or Arch on it
2013-10-28 11:33:00	Sunstrike	I dual boot Fedora+Mavericks
2013-10-28 11:33:04	Sunstrike	And it's good
2013-10-28 11:34:44	angusp	Yeah, I have a late 2011 mac mini and decided against Mountain lion, so no mavericks for me
2013-10-28 11:35:34	angusp	Do you think they'll ever get around to OS XI
2013-10-28 11:35:43	StrawHatter	You guys going to ILA?
2013-10-28 11:35:47	Sunstrike	XI sounds wrong. I imagine they'll do a new name.
2013-10-28 11:35:49	Sunstrike	And yup
2013-10-28 11:36:04	Sunstrike	Lectures are much more useful than the tome they order us to use
2013-10-28 11:36:48	Sunstrike	That tome is wall-of-text central, in Mathglish not English
2013-10-28 11:37:40	StrawHatter	I wish they did the section we have to read in the lecture then we have the reading test
2013-10-28 11:38:01	Sunstrike	Aye! I always said that… The reading tests are pointless as the textbook is impossible to understand
2013-10-28 11:38:07	StrawHatter	^^^^^^
2013-10-28 11:38:13	Sunstrike	Unless, ya know, you're -doing- a Maths degree
2013-10-28 11:38:18	Sunstrike	Which… We're not
2013-10-28 11:38:18	StrawHatter	I thought I was the only one who thought this!
2013-10-28 11:38:23	Sunstrike	Hell no xD
2013-10-28 11:38:36	Sunstrike	I hate ILA. I would rather suffer the "badly taught" Mathematics for Informatics course.
2013-10-28 11:38:52	StrawHatter	I hate Vectors in general... 
2013-10-28 11:39:04	Sunstrike	^ Why I'll never do proper game dev :p
2013-10-28 11:39:17	Sunstrike	Vectors, vectors everywhere!
2013-10-28 11:39:46	StrawHatter	Calculus isn't /as/ bad as ILA but still, this is coming from someone who only did Higher Maths so I have no idea what the Calculus is going to be like :/
2013-10-28 11:40:06	Reid	You don't want to know about Maths for Informatics
2013-10-28 11:40:09	Reid	You really, really don't
2013-10-28 11:40:10	Sunstrike	I did AH… Almost completely. And failed it.
2013-10-28 11:40:25	angusp	MAths textbooks are harder to read than machine code
2013-10-28 11:40:28	Reid	For the record, chunks of calculus are easy
2013-10-28 11:40:40	Reid	Other chunks are a pain
2013-10-28 11:40:48	Sunstrike	Maths textbooks ~= machine code yes
2013-10-28 11:41:00	Reid	No, no, machine code is logical
2013-10-28 11:41:04	Sunstrike	Oh, true
2013-10-28 11:41:05	Reid	Maths textbooks, less so
2013-10-28 11:41:07	StrawHatter	I remember they showed us a thingy for Calculus in the ILA tutorial once... I'm fairly certain that was the last time I went to a tutorial :P
2013-10-28 11:41:14	Sunstrike	So it's not just me that thinks they make stupid leaps of logic in their proofs?
2013-10-28 11:41:32	angusp	Well, machine code by definition is either wrong or logical, maths textbooks??? dunno
2013-10-28 11:41:33	 *	Sunstrike can't do maths proofs
2013-10-28 11:41:58	 *	angusp doesn't understand why he needs to prove something that's obvious
2013-10-28 11:42:02	Sunstrike	Yeah…
2013-10-28 11:42:24	 *	StrawHatter can't prove anything to save his life aside from video game related things
2013-10-28 11:42:26	Sunstrike	What I'd love… Is a course that teaches us what we -need- to know, not… How the hell it all works. We have mathematicians for that, right? :p
2013-10-28 11:42:34	StrawHatter	^^^^^^^
2013-10-28 11:42:37	Reid	There is a sad disjoint between "assume they know maths and say what you're doing" and "assume they know NOTHING"
2013-10-28 11:42:39	StrawHatter	this oh my gosh
2013-10-28 11:42:52	Reid	Knowing how it works is something you need to know for algorithms
2013-10-28 11:43:00	Reid	Much as it pains me to say it
2013-10-28 11:43:04	 *	angusp secretly likes the theoretical aspect :-(
2013-10-28 11:43:06	Sunstrike	For algorithms yes. But proofs are not required.
2013-10-28 11:43:28	Reid	Sometimes you need to prove that you're right in your claim
2013-10-28 11:43:37	angusp	At least we don't have to do formal proof by induction
2013-10-28 11:43:38	Reid	And the methods used to prove things are again pretty important for algorithms
2013-10-28 11:43:39	Sunstrike	But we have maths students for that :p
2013-10-28 11:43:44	StrawHatter	I'm totally gonna give in a full essay of things that should be changed in the course at the end of the semester!
2013-10-28 11:43:46	Reid	Not proof by induction, but proof by induction is easy
2013-10-28 11:43:57	Reid	Nah, maths students don't understand algorithms.
2013-10-28 11:44:05	StrawHatter	Proof by induction is the only proofing method I understand ... Barely
2013-10-28 11:44:15	angusp	Reid: not for nasties like Sigma and Pi notation
2013-10-28 11:44:24	StrawHatter	... Is Pi coming back?
2013-10-28 11:44:25	Sunstrike	Leave the complex math proofing to maths people. I only need to know stuff like "how does this work so I can implement it?"
2013-10-28 11:44:59	Sunstrike	Not "I can do this stupid leap of logic, followed by -this- stupid leap of logic, to prove this, which somehow in turn proves this seemingly unrelated thing"
2013-10-28 11:45:17	angusp	Sunstrike: sounds about right :D
2013-10-28 11:45:18	Sunstrike	That's what I see when reading maths proofs :p
2013-10-28 11:45:18	Reid	Go read some of the ads course stuff
2013-10-28 11:45:25	Reid	Then you'll know why you need it
2013-10-28 11:45:39	StrawHatter	Reid: What's ads? 
2013-10-28 11:46:43	Sunstrike	Maths proofs make such leaps of logic that I'd just call unreasonable - Jumping halfway across the subject for a random, barely relatable fact
2013-10-28 11:47:08	Sunstrike	If my mind were a JVM, it'd be throwing stack overflow exceptions at every maths proof :p
2013-10-28 11:47:18	angusp	Sunstrike: But technically you're allowed to do that, and if it gets you yoir proof faster...
2013-10-28 11:47:18	Reid	StrawHatter: Algorithms and Data Structures
2013-10-28 11:47:29	Reid	Third year course. One you should basically definitely take.
2013-10-28 11:47:45	Sunstrike	But my memory is piss. I can't hold enough information at once to -make- those jumps
2013-10-28 11:48:00	StrawHatter	Isn't Algorithims just a way to solve a problem though? 
2013-10-28 11:48:02	angusp	Reid: Still not sure what the difference between an algorithmand a clever piece of code is :[
2013-10-28 11:48:06	StrawHatter	... Never mind
2013-10-28 11:48:11	StrawHatter	I was being silly for a moment there
2013-10-28 11:48:33	angusp	Sunstrike: You could check on ebay for more ram?
2013-10-28 11:48:42	Sunstrike	Brain RAM. I want it.
2013-10-28 11:49:17	StrawHatter	What about... A Brain SSD?
2013-10-28 11:49:18	Reid	angusp: Clever code is an impleentation of an algorithm
2013-10-28 11:49:35	angusp	Anyways, we have ILA soon and I need to get my shite together so see StrawHatter and Sunstrike there

2013-10-28 14:07:29	StrawHatter	KitB: Case Syntax is Case Select right? 
2013-10-28 14:07:46	KitB	Also sort of
2013-10-28 14:08:02	KitB	It can be used in that way
2013-10-28 14:08:07	KitB	but it is also more than that
2013-10-28 14:08:19	KitB	With Case you can perform pattern matching
2013-10-28 14:09:46	KitB	So you can do stuff like:
2013-10-28 14:09:54	KitB	case args of
2013-10-28 14:10:09	KitB	    [a, b] -> (a, b)
2013-10-28 14:10:32	KitB	    [a] -> (a, a ++ ".svg")

2013-10-28 14:12:09	KitB	(except with a worse error message)
2013-10-28 14:19:32	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-28 14:19:50	StrawHatter	So
2013-10-28 14:20:00	StrawHatter	Haskell has 2 ways of doing Case Select pretty much? 
2013-10-28 14:20:25	KitB	Well sort of
2013-10-28 14:21:02	StrawHatter	Haskell sure is a tricky customer
2013-10-28 14:21:09	KitB	There's guards which are more like conditionals
2013-10-28 14:21:22	KitB	But you can implement a case using just conditionals
2013-10-28 14:21:36	KitB	(like in Python, where there is no case or switch statement)
2013-10-28 14:21:37	StrawHatter	That's mainly what I use Case for, HUGE big, if then else trees
2013-10-28 14:22:03	KitB	and in Haskell we use guards for such things
2013-10-28 14:22:38	KitB	The concept of multiple equations for a single function is how we do cases
2013-10-28 14:22:51	KitB	so you can do:
2013-10-28 14:22:58	KitB	f 1 = 1

2013-10-28 16:54:33	Jammy	I plan on bitching about Seagate
2013-10-28 16:54:39	Jammy	fucking Seagate
2013-10-28 16:55:10	Jammy	I bitched about them on Twitter, and they seem to be trying to help
2013-10-28 16:55:20	@amazoph	Jammy: ikr. i had one disk go on me a few years ago, granted they did send a replacement that was of a higher capacity.
2013-10-28 16:55:28	Jammy	I'm almost considering going along with it, just to see their response to this
2013-10-28 16:55:36	Jammy	"What troubleshooting steps have you taken?"
2013-10-28 16:55:41	Jammy	"I put it in the freezer"
2013-10-28 16:55:43	Jammy	"What?"
2013-10-28 16:55:44	@amazoph	still not trusted these two drives since... they are sitting in a box while I decide what to do with them
2013-10-28 16:55:50	Jammy	"The freezer. I put the hard drive in the freezer"
2013-10-28 16:56:07	Jammy	amazoph: I've now had 2 go after just over a year of use
2013-10-28 16:56:15	Jammy	like, total mechanical failure
2013-10-28 16:56:20	stesh	Seagate ;__;
2013-10-28 16:56:22	stesh	kill it with fire
2013-10-28 16:57:16	Jammy	and they're like "Which OS are you using?"
2013-10-28 16:57:17	@amazoph	the ones I had were from a batch that supposedly had a firmware defect... they had a chance to randomly brick themselves on every power on
2013-10-28 16:57:26	Jammy	I don't think changing OS is going to fix the fact that it's fucking die
2013-10-28 16:57:28	Jammy	died*
2013-10-28 16:57:36	Jammy	plus, the BIOS won't even talk to it anymore
2013-10-28 16:57:52	Jammy	this one had a very sudden failure
2013-10-28 16:57:57	Jammy	no SMART warnings ever
2013-10-28 16:58:06	Jammy	suddenly can't read any files
2013-10-28 16:58:08	Jammy	reboot
2013-10-28 16:58:17	Jammy	click click click click click click click click
2013-10-28 16:58:40	Velox	I once had Seagate tell me that I couldn't RMA a drive after 2 months of use because I used linux and that invalidates the warranty...
2013-10-28 16:58:51	Jammy	the fuck?
2013-10-28 16:58:59	Jammy	I've bought a couple of WD Reds
2013-10-28 16:59:05	Jammy	one to replace the broken Seagate
2013-10-28 16:59:16	Jammy	and one to replace another Seagate that's currently being used
2013-10-28 16:59:27	@amazoph	Velox: :facedesk:
2013-10-28 16:59:51	Jammy	turns out there are another couple of seagates which came with the HP microservers I bought
2013-10-28 17:00:04	@amazoph	i replaced my seagates with two WD Blacks when I last rebuilt my desktop
2013-10-28 17:00:11	Sunstrike	I love my WD drives.
2013-10-28 17:00:12	Jammy	but I'll let them live for now, seeing as they're just being OS drives and the actual data is going on others
2013-10-28 17:00:19	Sunstrike	But now I know to avoid Seagate :P
2013-10-28 17:00:21	Jammy	and the config files are backed up
2013-10-28 17:00:30	Jammy	or will be once I've got the new WDs up and running
2013-10-28 17:01:11	Sunstrike	My main PC uses a WD Green and… A Raptor from some company (can't recall)
2013-10-28 17:01:48	Jammy	errr, wasn't Raptor WD as well? :D
2013-10-28 17:02:13	Jammy	oh, it also turned out I had a Samsung Seagate Barracuda Green Spinpoint F4
2013-10-28 17:02:21	Jammy	like, it literally said all of those things on them
2013-10-28 17:02:33	Sunstrike	…Whut
2013-10-28 17:02:34	Jammy	from what I managed to work out online, it's more Samsung than Seagate though
2013-10-28 17:02:37	Jammy	so that also gets to live
2013-10-28 17:02:42	Sunstrike	And yeah, WD Raptor I think it is
2013-10-28 17:02:54	Jammy	apparently Seagate bought the Samsung HD division
2013-10-28 17:02:57	Sunstrike	Free hand-me-down components~
2013-10-28 17:03:25	Jammy	eventually, the Spinpoint F4 was rebranded as the Barracuda Green
2013-10-28 17:03:39	Sunstrike	Hence that stupidly long name?
2013-10-28 17:03:49	Jammy	but for a time, it was branded mainly as the Samsung Spinpoint S4 still, but also branded as Barracuda Green in the top right of the label
2013-10-28 17:03:52	Jammy	I have one of those ones
2013-10-28 17:04:05	Sunstrike	Heh
2013-10-28 17:04:15	Jammy	I think they were basically drives that were still around when Seagate bought the company
2013-10-28 17:04:21	Jammy	so they just put a new label on
2013-10-28 17:04:40	Sunstrike	"Oh… new drive err… slap a sticker on and sell it. Yes."
2013-10-28 17:04:51	angusp	Jammy: I feel your pain. Just had a pre-fail warning go off on TWO SCSIs. :'(
2013-10-28 17:05:27	Sunstrike	I'm lucky in that none of my servers hold "critical" data
2013-10-28 17:05:45	Sunstrike	So if they die… It's not -so- bad. Annoying yes, problem? Nah
2013-10-28 17:05:50	@drayshak	mmm SSDs
2013-10-28 17:05:51	angusp	Sunstrike: Snap. I can deal with 1 drive fail though, 2 and I'm fucked
2013-10-28 17:05:57	Sunstrike	Yeah
2013-10-28 17:07:06	Jammy	angusp: At least they're giing you a warning :D
2013-10-28 17:07:13	angusp	At least I can get replacement scsis off ebay for not too much, as their capacity is tiny
2013-10-28 17:07:20	Jammy	drayshak: I use an SSD for my OS drive, but for bulk storage?
2013-10-28 17:07:26	Jammy	I aint made of money yet yo
2013-10-28 17:07:31	@drayshak	haha yeah
2013-10-28 17:07:44	Jammy	maybe in a couple of years
2013-10-28 17:08:02	Jammy	I can't wait until the 512GB SSDs are sub £100
2013-10-28 17:08:07	Jammy	heck, even sub £150
2013-10-28 17:08:41	angusp	Jammy: I got kernel messages and flashing orange lights and a cryptic error nessage that was like E08F1 on the bezel
2013-10-28 18:01:44	angusp	KitB: Ping
2013-10-28 18:02:13	KitB	pong
2013-10-28 18:05:24	Sunstrike	Angus, have you found a network pong game yet we can rig up on DICE?
2013-10-28 18:06:38	angusp	Sunstrike: Hahaha, should have a look for that
2013-10-28 18:06:46	angusp	KitB: Is this pub thing still on?
2013-10-28 18:07:18	Sunstrike	Angus, we don't even need a 'floordog' server; just SSH tunnel it to one of your own hosts renamed to that ;D
2013-10-28 18:07:20	KitB	of course
2013-10-28 18:07:45	angusp	Sunstrike: Might rename one of my Pis to floordog
2013-10-28 18:07:57	Sunstrike	And then do the tunnel/pong game? Yesss…
2013-10-28 18:08:15	angusp	could be interesting with ssh lag
2013-10-28 18:08:56	Sunstrike	Ohyes
2013-10-28 18:09:09	Sunstrike	But it'd be worth it just to see a ceilingcat vs floordog game of Pong
2013-10-28 18:09:10	angusp	KitB: Is i the Auld Hoose?
2013-10-28 18:09:36	angusp	Sunstrike: You could even do it in screen and just get good at C-a Tabbing
2013-10-28 18:09:46	Sunstrike	Hah
2013-10-28 18:14:08	KitB	angusp: Indeed.
2013-10-28 18:14:46	KitB	Why would you need to use SSH or anything?
2013-10-28 18:14:51	KitB	You can just run stuff.
2013-10-28 18:15:02	Sunstrike	Nah we want to link 'ceilingcat' and 'floordog'
2013-10-28 18:15:14	Sunstrike	And make them compete
2013-10-28 18:15:33	angusp	KitB: We thought it's be funny to get the DICE machine to play pong over a tunnel with a hypothetical machine called floordog
2013-10-28 18:19:53	Sunstrike	We were bored. And angusp and hamhut were playing with each others TTYs

2013-10-29 22:56:06	stesh	StrawHatter: it's surprisingly difficult to lose data from a git repository

2013-10-29 22:56:30	Sunstrike	You'd have to go pretty mad on a Git repo to delete history

2013-10-29 22:58:10	StrawHatter	How mad

2013-10-29 23:01:41	hamhut|beingsocial	yeah, i haven't lost anythin - to date from using git, short of nukng my hdd
2013-10-29 23:03:43	StrawHatter	What happened to you being social?
2013-10-29 23:05:07	hamhut|beingsocial	oh yeah, its kinda happening, but work isnalso kinda being done too, so i'm slightly distracting myself
2013-10-29 23:05:59	hamhut|beingsocial	i shouldn't have chosen such a long name, its messed up my weechat, i have almost no useful screen space
2013-10-29 23:08:08	StrawHatter	Why not change it to "hamhut|socialising"? that might make it easier?

2013-10-30 08:22:24	Jammy	I'm always up this early
2013-10-30 08:22:32	Jammy	I just usually don't go on IRC
2013-10-30 08:23:31	hamhut	ah, are you in UoE?
2013-10-30 08:24:43	Jammy	no, I escaped earlier this year

2013-10-30 08:27:05	Jammy	it's difficult to keep track of how many years you spend in that hell hole
2013-10-30 08:27:14	Jammy	I think it was 4
2013-10-30 08:32:57	hamhut	srsly? why did you drop out? other than not liking it... or another more specific question, why is it a hell hole?
2013-10-30 08:33:55	Jammy	I didn't drop out :P
2013-10-30 08:34:15	hamhut	oh :p
2013-10-30 08:34:33	hamhut	I was led to beliove you had=
2013-10-30 08:35:40	Jammy	and it's a hell hole because by the end of it, you're spending 16 hours a day working on problems that have already been solved, learning quite a bit of irrelevant stuff and not being paid for it, or in some cases, paying for the priveledge
2013-10-30 08:37:17	hamhut	fair nuff, but was the work at least interesting?

2013-10-30 08:49:18	Jammy	the computer looks at things and goes "I CAN SIT ON THAT"

2013-10-30 09:34:59	Jammy	would have been if it didn't suck
2013-10-30 09:35:04	Jammy	it was my worst mark ever
2013-10-30 09:36:16	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-30 09:36:18	StrawHatter	derp
2013-10-30 09:36:29	StrawHatter	was this for 4th year?
2013-10-30 09:43:36	Jammy	yup!
2013-10-30 09:43:46	Jammy	I like to think it was partly due to lack of motivation
2013-10-30 09:44:28	Jammy	it's hard to convince yourself that putting a lot of work in all year is worth it when you've got a job offer already
2013-10-30 09:45:32	StrawHatter	so true so true
2013-10-30 09:45:41	KitB	It's getting somewhat hard to be motivated even without a job offer
2013-10-30 09:45:54	KitB	during my 5th year of this degree
2013-10-30 09:47:08	KitB	though not for my project
2013-10-30 09:47:17	KitB	That's fairly easy to motivate myself to do
2013-10-30 09:47:22	KitB	because it's fun
2013-10-30 09:47:28	KitB	and worth half of my total marks this year
2013-10-30 09:48:05	StrawHatter	is it true that like 90% of your actual mark comes from work in 4th year?
2013-10-30 09:49:22	Jammy	what do you mean by work?
2013-10-30 09:49:30	Jammy	all of your marks come from work in every year
2013-10-30 09:49:49	Jammy	we don't do those credits for attending a meeting with your personal tutor and stuff that some other unis do
2013-10-30 09:50:24	StrawHatter	ugh
2013-10-30 09:50:55	Jammy	still disappointed that the uni didn't accept my credits from Helsinki for doing things like attending orientation or completing my study plan or drinking
2013-10-30 09:51:05	StrawHatter	does that mean that first year actually maters?
2013-10-30 09:51:18	Jammy	I think I actually came back with 70 credits, rather than the 60 I needed
2013-10-30 09:51:24	Jammy	and no, it doesn't
2013-10-30 09:51:31	Jammy	well, as long as you pass
2013-10-30 09:51:55	Jammy	second year there's some requirement I can't remember to do with getting 50% in some amount of informatics courses or you can't go in to 4th year
2013-10-30 09:52:06	Jammy	3rd and 4th year actually count towards your degree
2013-10-30 09:52:12	StrawHatter	oh phew
2013-10-30 09:52:18	Jammy	unless you go away for 3rd year
2013-10-30 09:52:26	Jammy	in which case, everything is on 4th year
2013-10-30 09:52:44	Jammy	and first year really shouldn't be a problem for you anyway
2013-10-30 09:53:05	Jammy	like, if you're struggling now, you really need to try and sort that ASAP
2013-10-30 09:53:18	Jammy	because the difficulty ramps up a lot very quickly after that
2013-10-30 09:53:34	StrawHatter	it's not so much sturggling, it's a lack of wanting to work
2013-10-30 09:53:59	Jammy	well that's kind of struggling
2013-10-30 09:54:02	Jammy	or at least, it depends
2013-10-30 09:54:20	Jammy	I didn't do much work in first year, and still almost aced it
2013-10-30 09:54:43	Jammy	but if not doing much work means that you do badly in first year, I think it's time somebody tells you that years tends to follow on from eachother
2013-10-30 09:55:01	Jammy	your marks may not count this year, but if you don't already know the stuff that's being taught, you're going to have a bad time in second year
2013-10-30 09:55:26	Jammy	and if you have a bad time in second year, you're going to have a bad time in third year and so on
2013-10-30 09:55:31	StrawHatter	ow
2013-10-30 09:55:47	Jammy	none of this means you're totally screwed, because you *can* usually work hard and catch up
2013-10-30 09:55:52	Jammy	at least during the first 2 years
2013-10-30 09:56:02	Jammy	after that, you have a pretty high workload anyway
2013-10-30 09:56:12	StrawHatter	whelp
2013-10-30 09:56:17	Jammy	basically, don't panic
2013-10-30 09:56:37	Jammy	and if you know everything you're being taught this year, by all means just party and don't work
2013-10-30 09:56:58	Jammy	but if you're not working AND you don't know everything, then it's probably time you start turning up to tutorials
2013-10-30 09:58:16	StrawHatter	i
2013-10-30 09:58:21	StrawHatter	should probably start working then like omg
2013-10-30 10:00:22	StrawHatter	oh
2013-10-30 10:00:47	StrawHatter	This
2013-10-30 10:00:53	StrawHatter	Might actually be catach-upable
2013-10-30 10:01:40	Jammy	that's exacly what I just said :P
2013-10-30 10:02:10	Jammy	in first year, if you're doing everything you should, you're probably working for like... 24 hours a week?
2013-10-30 10:02:23	Jammy	which leaves a hell of a lot of time for catching up on the first half of the semester
2013-10-30 10:02:47	StrawHatter	24 hours?!
2013-10-30 10:04:06	StrawHatter	That's... Actually not as much as I thought at first glance 
2013-10-30 10:04:30	Jammy	oh good god
2013-10-30 10:04:53	Jammy	if that sounds worrying to you, you need to reevaluate your idea of work
2013-10-30 10:05:52	Jammy	let's put it this way
2013-10-30 10:06:04	StrawHatter	I'm extremely lazy about doing things that don't interest me much
2013-10-30 10:06:07	Jammy	at the 3rd/4th year level, 10 credits should take 100 hours of work
2013-10-30 10:06:13	Jammy	you do 60 credits a semester
2013-10-30 10:06:19	Jammy	so 600 hours per semester
2013-10-30 10:06:31	Jammy	which is... 11 weeks long?
2013-10-30 10:06:38	Jammy	so like... just over 54 hours a week
2013-10-30 10:06:42	StrawHatter	Fudge
2013-10-30 10:06:51	StrawHatter	I thought semesters were 12 weeks
2013-10-30 10:06:56	Jammy	and some courses take more than 100 hours
2013-10-30 10:07:11	Jammy	oh yeah, they extended them, didn't they

2013-10-30 10:07:48	StrawHatter	hwat
2013-10-30 10:08:02	Jammy	if you have an extra week, your lecturers know you have an extra week, and the course gets bigger
2013-10-30 10:08:08	Jammy	probably by like 2 weeks worth of work
2013-10-30 10:08:13	StrawHatter	....

2013-10-30 10:17:20	hamhut	I have to write an essay for tmrw too
2013-10-30 10:17:43	hamhut	strawhatter, assume your tut is still on.
2013-10-30 10:18:07	hamhut	kitb, cool, are you still doing the tut tmrw? with the strike and everything? it could be dangerous
2013-10-30 10:18:23	KitB	I am part of no unions
2013-10-30 10:18:42	KitB	Therefore I am not involved in any strike action
2013-10-30 10:18:54	KitB	I don't even know what the strike is about
2013-10-30 10:19:17	Jammy	KitB: I assume the tories being dicks
2013-10-30 10:19:55	@drayshak	university staff have had their pay frozen for the third year in a row
2013-10-30 10:19:56	@StarSCREAM	something about pay
2013-10-30 10:19:58	@drayshak	the strike it about that.
2013-10-30 10:20:01	KitB	Looks like a pay rise strike
2013-10-30 10:20:05	@StarSCREAM	yeah what drayshak said
2013-10-30 10:20:11	@drayshak	* is
2013-10-30 10:20:19	KitB	I get paid more than enough
2013-10-30 10:20:27	@drayshak	but yeah, KitB, I'd probably check to see if you're expected to show up or not
2013-10-30 10:20:33	KitB	and am not a member of the unions
2013-10-30 10:21:00	Jammy	I'd probably just show up
2013-10-30 10:21:02	KitB	I'll be turning up tomorrow either way
2013-10-30 10:21:21	Jammy	last time there was a lecturers strike, I can only think of 1 Inf lecturer that took part
2013-10-30 10:21:34	 *	StrawHatter giggles
2013-10-30 10:21:41	@StarSCREAM	the PI lecturer is I think?
2013-10-30 10:21:47	StrawHatter	Classic Inf lecturers <3
2013-10-30 10:21:47	KitB	Was it Wadler?
2013-10-30 10:22:00	StrawHatter	I'd imagine Wadler to be pretty rich tbh
2013-10-30 10:22:00	Jammy	KitB: Nah, that Alex woman
2013-10-30 10:22:06	Jammy	can't remember her surname
2013-10-30 10:22:07	KitB	Lascarides?
2013-10-30 10:22:16	KitB	Taught Inf2D
2013-10-30 10:22:16	Jammy	we had her for Inf 2 something
2013-10-30 10:22:19	Jammy	that's the one
2013-10-30 10:22:23	KitB	She's my PT
2013-10-30 10:22:29	Jammy	oh
2013-10-30 10:22:35	Jammy	well don't try and see your PT tomorrow
2013-10-30 10:22:37	Jammy	:P
2013-10-30 10:22:39	KitB	:P
2013-10-30 10:22:56	Jammy	I wonder if Brian is on strike
2013-10-30 10:23:03	Jammy	you should go and picket his office
2013-10-30 10:23:19	KitB	Well I'll be having a meeting with Ian later today
2013-10-30 10:23:42	KitB	and Brian usually has a meeting with Ian just before mine
2013-10-30 10:23:54	StrawHatter	that reminds me, do all people in 4/5th years get offices?
2013-10-30 10:23:54	KitB	(this year, at least)
2013-10-30 10:23:58	KitB	Hell no
2013-10-30 10:24:02	Jammy	lololol
2013-10-30 10:24:09	Jammy	I like to put a desk in the elevator
2013-10-30 10:24:14	KitB	only PhD students get offices to my knowledge
2013-10-30 10:24:27	KitB	and they're running out of space for them
2013-10-30 10:25:50	KitB	There was talk last year of getting a MInf5 working room
2013-10-30 10:26:12	KitB	But again there's not enough space
2013-10-30 10:27:27	Jammy	maybe we should get rid of offices entirely and just use the cutting edge Cisco WebEx technology to collaborate from wherever we may be
2013-10-30 10:27:40	Jammy	I am the lord of remote work said he
2013-10-30 10:27:47	KitB	We could totally use Hangouts
2013-10-30 10:27:59	Jammy	Lync 4 lyf
2013-10-30 10:28:00	Jammy	wait
2013-10-30 10:28:02	Jammy	errrrr
2013-10-30 10:28:04	Jammy	I didn't just say that
2013-10-30 10:28:12	KitB	10:28 < Jammy> Lync 4 lyf
2013-10-30 10:28:19	Jammy	goddammit
2013-10-30 10:28:25	Jammy	but seriously man
2013-10-30 10:28:28	Jammy	WebEx is the shit
2013-10-30 10:28:36	Jammy	does hangouts have a ball?
2013-10-30 10:28:42	KitB	Maybe .. ?
2013-10-30 10:28:45	Jammy	can you click a raise hand button?
2013-10-30 10:28:51	KitB	No
2013-10-30 10:28:54	Jammy	BOOM
2013-10-30 10:28:55	KitB	But you can raise your hand
2013-10-30 10:29:12	Jammy	what if you are collaborating with many many people and cannot see them all on video?
2013-10-30 10:29:22	KitB	Then they speak up
2013-10-30 10:29:24	Jammy	how do you signal that you have a question without interrupting then?
2013-10-30 10:29:39	KitB	I can see the utility of such a function
2013-10-30 10:29:53	KitB	But Hangouts is free
2013-10-30 10:29:57	Jammy	and you can't be like "Who has the ball? Errrrr.... ok, I've got the ball now"
2013-10-30 10:30:39	Jammy	we had hilarious audio problems with hangouts at FreeAgent
2013-10-30 10:31:10	KitB	We had a wonderful time using Hangouts for VC at Google

2013-10-30 10:32:40	Jammy	Skype seemed to sometimes forget that we had a microphone

2013-10-30 10:37:32	StrawHatter	yeah, skype does that from time to time :P

2013-10-30 11:13:08	StrawHatter	Right, time to try out this optional stuff
2013-10-30 11:13:22	KitB	Which tutorial are you doing?
2013-10-30 11:13:46	StrawHatter	Numero Uno
2013-10-30 11:14:16	KitB	splendid
2013-10-30 11:14:33	KitB	If you start finding the optional material too hard later on
2013-10-30 11:14:34	KitB	don't worry
2013-10-30 11:14:35	StrawHatter	Gotta start at number 1 and work upwards right? </3
2013-10-30 11:14:50	KitB	The optional material is often much harder than the exam
2013-10-30 11:15:03	StrawHatter	I had a quick glance at the stuff for tutorial 5
2013-10-30 11:15:07	StrawHatter	It doesn't look very pretty

2013-10-30 11:15:29	Jammy	I just remember finding $ confusing and pretty much avoiding it
2013-10-30 11:17:05	hamhut	$ is pretty awesome, It allows the use of less brackets
2013-10-30 11:17:25	KitB	Don't forget mapping values over functions, padawan
2013-10-30 11:17:28	hamhut	I'm a little scared of pointless style,
2013-10-30 11:18:19	hamhut	haven't done that yet, but this weeks tutorial is quite interesting, think I'm gonna have to open my book :(
2013-10-30 11:18:30	KitB	Oh you won't ever have to
2013-10-30 11:18:35	StrawHatter	question, in the exam, will they give us the Data Flow?
2013-10-30 11:18:49	StrawHatter	Like, [String] -> [String] ?
2013-10-30 11:18:53	KitB	But it's an example of how ($) is more than just a replacement for parentheses
2013-10-30 11:19:14	KitB	StrawHatter: Unless there's a question that explicitly asks you to give the type of something
2013-10-30 11:19:33	KitB	You shouldn't think of it as Data Flow
2013-10-30 11:20:07	KitB	a function of a -> b -> c doesn't take an 'a', turn it into a 'b', then turn that into a 'c'
2013-10-30 11:20:11	StrawHatter	But but but, it's the flow of data... kinda... not really but still!
2013-10-30 11:20:23	KitB	it takes an 'a' and a 'b' and turns them into a 'c'
2013-10-30 11:20:45	Jammy	it's just a retarded syntax for all of the types going into or out of a function
2013-10-30 11:20:54	Jammy	why they chose -> I will never understand
2013-10-30 11:20:54	KitB	It's a small distinction but one that might help you later on ;)
2013-10-30 11:20:58	Jammy	it is very misleading
2013-10-30 11:21:04	KitB	Because currying
2013-10-30 11:21:41	StrawHatter	wait so, in the exam, do we get the "a -> b -> c" thingy?
2013-10-30 11:21:43	KitB	f :: a -> b -> c == f :: a -> (b -> c)
2013-10-30 11:22:19	KitB	StrawHatter: The exam will be a lot like the tutorial exercises
2013-10-30 11:22:34	StrawHatter	oh.. I'm kinda cool with that
2013-10-30 11:22:57	KitB	If you can do the first five or so tutorial exercises you'll do fine on the exam
2013-10-30 11:23:07	KitB	Unless they significantly change the content of the exam
2013-10-30 11:23:11	KitB	Which I doubt they will do
2013-10-30 11:24:30	StrawHatter	I'm guessing we won't get it in a cute .pdf file though...
2013-10-30 11:24:47	KitB	Actually I'm pretty sure it will be available on the machine as a PDF
2013-10-30 11:25:17	Jammy	yeah, I seem to remember it was too
2013-10-30 11:25:30	KitB	I mean the sheets on the desks will just be printed from a PDF like the tutorial ones
2013-10-30 11:26:45	StrawHatter	oh my gosh, yes! <333
2013-10-30 11:28:34	KitB	If you want to make things that look exactly like the tutorials you could look into LaTeX
2013-10-30 11:28:45	KitB	But I would concentrate on other things right now if I were you
2013-10-30 11:29:23	StrawHatter	haha yeah
2013-10-30 11:37:54	angusp	Anyone here?
2013-10-30 11:38:13	KitB	many people

2013-10-30 19:12:23	Sunstrike	Ooooo
2013-10-30 19:12:28	Sunstrike	As addictive… As Vimgolf?
2013-10-30 19:12:41	hamhut	more, because you racing other people
2013-10-30 19:12:48	hamhut	and you just NEED to be better :p
2013-10-30 19:12:48	Sunstrike	Oh my
2013-10-30 19:13:31	hamhut	and there are some interesting exerpts from random books, movies, games and things

2013-10-30 19:20:49	hamhut	yeah, I use Dvorak normal

2013-10-30 19:21:08	hamhut	what you said, I don't have any english keys on mine
2013-10-30 19:21:19	hamhut	that's a definite improvement
2013-10-30 19:21:30	hamhut	how are you learning?
2013-10-30 19:25:23	hamhut	I used gtypist, it's pretty good for getting started, gets you used to the home row pretty quickly
2013-10-30 19:27:17	hamhut	actually, just reinstalled it and am having fun
2013-10-30 19:27:23	hamhut	avoiding essay writing
2013-10-30 19:31:02	Sunstrike	Learning? I;m using the DvZine keyboard map and that racer :P
2013-10-30 19:31:10	Sunstrike	gtypist… Might be better
2013-10-30 19:35:14	hamhut	dvzine keyboard map?
2013-10-30 19:35:28	hamhut	it's cli too!! who doesn't love it?
2013-10-30 19:35:42	hamhut	oh yeah, have you read the zine? I assume so :p

2013-10-30 20:31:35	Sunstrike	Lesson D1 done with 0% errors. That took a while.
2013-10-30 20:32:02	hamhut	sunstrike, well done
2013-10-30 20:32:08	hamhut	I'll have a play in a second

2013-10-30 21:46:56	Sunstrike	angusp - Toby and Rahul aren't striking
2013-10-30 21:47:04	Sunstrike	FP tutorials… Well, depends on your tutor
2013-10-30 21:47:56	Sunstrike	So really going in or not is more… Do you -want- to cross that picket line, or will you join it? Or… Stay at home and do something else with the day. Either way :p
2013-10-30 21:49:52	angusp	Sunstrike: I have no intentions of crossing a picket line, if there is one, but if there isn't I want to go to the lecture
2013-10-30 21:50:22	angusp	Toby isn't going to go over the lecure material again
2013-10-30 21:52:07	Sunstrike	S'up to you.
2013-10-30 21:53:16	Sunstrike	Good news is 4.1 isn't that bad :p
2013-10-30 21:53:36	Sunstrike	So I don't feel so bad skipping it
2013-10-30 22:06:43	angusp	Hmmm, but I will be a bit pissed if I can't get into the lab in AT
2013-10-30 22:08:35	Sunstrike	Use the backdoor :p

2013-10-30 22:23:57	angusp	Sunstrike: IMO strikes should affect the people you're protesting against, i.e. the UNi, who I think will save money because of the strike

2013-10-30 22:27:07	StrawHatter	Fudge
2013-10-30 22:27:10	StrawHatter	We had maths to do
2013-10-30 22:36:11	angusp	StrawHatter: Almost CBA doing that
2013-10-30 22:38:54	StrawHatter	angusp: This isn't a very good work ethic we have going, is it? :P
2013-10-30 22:39:07	StrawHatter	Also
2013-10-30 22:39:54	StrawHatter	angusp: I thought UniofEdinburgh was like, extremely popular, thus wouldn't it have a lot of oversea students? Giving them insane amounts of money? This is one of the last universities that I thought would strike from a personal opinion.
2013-10-30 22:40:52	angusp	StrawHatter: It's not the Uni as a body, it's _some_ of the employees who feel they don't get enough of that money
2013-10-30 22:41:42	Sunstrike	A 13% effective pay cut isn't something to scoff at :p
2013-10-30 22:42:05	Sunstrike	Not to mention staff morale has a direct impact on the quality of teaching we receive
2013-10-30 22:42:42	angusp	13% is shocking, think that's the inflationchange, the actual figure has been fixed
2013-10-30 22:42:57	Sunstrike	Yeah
2013-10-30 22:43:01	angusp	Sunstrike: There are a lot of pros and cons which is why I haven't decided yet
2013-10-30 22:43:27	StrawHatter	... 13%!
2013-10-30 22:43:31	StrawHatter	What the actual fudge!
2013-10-30 22:43:55	StrawHatter	Now, would I be correct in assuming Uni lecturers get paid as much as school teachers?
2013-10-30 22:43:57	angusp	Yeah, /but/ the strike affects the students and not really the Uni
2013-10-30 22:44:05	angusp	StrawHatter: Probably less
2013-10-30 22:44:08	Sunstrike	I support the action on the basis that this directly harms us if it's allowed to continue, not to mention it's plainly wrong. It's especially bad when you consider admin staff have been getting pay rises, and money is being ear-marked for future -building- projects.
2013-10-30 22:44:18	StrawHatter	Holy ducking -bleep-
2013-10-30 22:44:31	StrawHatter	No wonder Rahul has no motivation to teaching us well!
2013-10-30 22:44:36	Sunstrike	Haha xD
2013-10-30 22:44:57	angusp	Sunstrike: Have you seen the plans for extending the inf forum and the dugald (?) stewart building
2013-10-30 22:45:03	Sunstrike	Nope?
2013-10-30 22:45:31	angusp	The forum is currently L shaped, they want to extend it to be almost square with a courtyard
2013-10-30 22:45:38	Sunstrike	I see
2013-10-30 22:45:55	StrawHatter	They really don't need to extend the Inf forum when lecturers aren't getting paid enough to teach
2013-10-30 22:46:00	angusp	not a viable thing to do if you're not paying people enough
2013-10-30 22:46:08	StrawHatter	^ this
2013-10-30 22:46:13	Sunstrike	Aye
2013-10-30 22:46:22	angusp	StrawHatter: Probably won't be an informatics building, rather more lecture theatres or offices
2013-10-30 22:47:07	StrawHatter	angusp: But it isn't needed.. or at least in my opinion. I'd rather lecturers who are 120% motivated than a super building
2013-10-30 22:47:45	angusp	/but/ I am (as a !scottish person) paying £9000 for this so... kinda want to go t lectures :-/
2013-10-30 22:48:11	StrawHatter	Oh... I don't think I'm paying any...
2013-10-30 22:48:13	StrawHatter	Woop woop
2013-10-30 22:51:00	angusp	Student loan?
2013-10-30 22:51:18	StrawHatter	I don't know
2013-10-30 22:51:29	StrawHatter	I literally just let my father do all things UCAS related
2013-10-30 22:51:58	angusp	You're scottish so you pay it indirectically via higher taxes all your life. Bummer :D

2013-10-30 22:55:00	StrawHatter	Just incase none of you guys know what kyute means, kyute = cute but putting a ky at the front makes it seem even kyuter

2013-10-30 23:12:28	angusp	But, toNNF is an absolute pain what with it's like 15 or so patterns
2013-10-30 23:12:34	Sunstrike	Yeah it is
2013-10-30 23:12:51	Sunstrike	Those optional exercises are all pattern-match madness
2013-10-30 23:13:21	angusp	Yup, I have most of them fine but (Not (a :<->: b)) isconfusing
2013-10-30 23:13:36	Sunstrike	Heh, yeah. Kinda cool that it works though.
2013-10-30 23:13:43	Sunstrike	Nested patterns and all
2013-10-30 23:14:06	Sunstrike	You could make it patterns all the way down. Until you reach Var "Turtle"
2013-10-30 23:14:07	StrawHatter	is this

2013-10-30 23:14:33	StrawHatter	Oh
2013-10-30 23:14:34	StrawHatter	I'm like
2013-10-30 23:14:45	StrawHatter	3 tutorials behind
2013-10-30 23:14:49	 *	StrawHatter sobs
2013-10-30 23:15:05	angusp	Yep, but what does that go to? I have quickcheck fails on about the 12th test with horrible props. at the moment it's going to (toNNF (Not a :->: b) :&: toNNF (b :-> Not a))
2013-10-30 23:15:10	Sunstrike	Tutorial 5 is cool. You get to really abuse Haskell's pattern matching.
2013-10-30 23:15:12	 *	angusp sobs louder
2013-10-30 23:15:39	Sunstrike	Now implement Davis-Putnam as the email suggested. Lol.
2013-10-30 23:17:20	angusp	Feck! Just got it. it needs to be an :|: in the middle cos of the negtion of !(A & B) thing! Feck me.
2013-10-30 23:17:38	Sunstrike	CL meets FP with torturous results.
2013-10-30 23:18:40	Sunstrike	Also TIL Scala has a propositional logic module built-in.
2013-10-30 23:18:57	Sunstrike	Is Scala becoming the new emacs? A command for everything? :P
2013-10-30 23:22:11	angusp	Sunstrike: Casual stab at emacs :D
2013-10-30 23:22:24	Sunstrike	:D
2013-10-30 23:23:29	StrawHatter	Guys.. I think I've hit a new low.. I've actually made a study plan
2013-10-30 23:23:48	Sunstrike	Achievement: More organised than the rest of us
2013-10-30 23:24:19	angusp	Woah - slow down for a second man!
2013-10-30 23:24:43	StrawHatter	Well, unlike you guys, I have been doing fudge all in terms of FP and IM so I should probably start working on them.
2013-10-30 23:25:15	Sunstrike	I've been doing… Some work, on CL and all the FP stuff. ILA… Err… yeah, I need to get working on that
2013-10-30 23:25:29	StrawHatter	2 hours a day of FP, 1 of ILA and 1 of CL every second day
2013-10-30 23:25:31	Sunstrike	But 4.1 was awesomely easy
2013-10-30 23:25:41	StrawHatter	That's pmuch what it is
2013-10-30 23:25:49	StrawHatter	4.1?
2013-10-30 23:25:55	Sunstrike	ILA. Section 4.1
2013-10-30 23:25:55	StrawHatter	OH FUDGE! THE MATHS
2013-10-30 23:25:55	StrawHatter	UGH
2013-10-30 23:26:02	Sunstrike	It's super easy. Honest.
2013-10-30 23:26:12	Sunstrike	Eigenvectors/values aren't that bad.
2013-10-30 23:26:23	Sunstrike	This unit has 100% less abstraction so far :D
2013-10-30 23:26:46	StrawHatter	I'm kinda happy though
2013-10-30 23:27:03	StrawHatter	I think I've finally found actual motivation at last for wanting to do well at university
2013-10-30 23:27:06	angusp	WOOOO!OOOO!!OO!O!O!OO!O Just got toNNF to work!!!! #adrenaline-caffeine-buzz
2013-10-30 23:29:26	Sunstrike	I'm writing a message processor in Scala. It's cool. People register messages and "pipeline units"… then when the processor runs, it chucks every message through every unit using map.
2013-10-30 23:29:53	Sunstrike	Or in Scala, a "For Comprehension"
2013-10-30 23:30:45	StrawHatter	How long is 4.1?
2013-10-30 23:30:49	Sunstrike	Short.
2013-10-30 23:31:17	StrawHatter	Hello new favourite chapter <3
2013-10-30 23:31:21	Sunstrike	Yus
2013-10-30 23:31:31	Sunstrike	It's also the first unit in ages I managed to ace the reading test in
2013-10-30 23:32:12	Sunstrike	You need… Determinants, Matrix Multiplication and Quadratics (the easy sort, not the ones needing that stupid formula)
2013-10-30 23:32:38	angusp	Oh, so I'll just hit it in like 1 min with a graphic calc?
2013-10-30 23:33:05	StrawHatter	ohhh
2013-10-30 23:33:08	StrawHatter	I think I sorta get this stuff
2013-10-30 23:33:19	StrawHatter	I think
2013-10-30 23:33:23	StrawHatter	No guarantees
2013-10-30 23:34:02	angusp	^^ this

2013-10-30 23:36:34	StrawHatter	Should I just
2013-10-30 23:36:40	StrawHatter	Do the test, or should I read over it?
2013-10-30 23:38:20	StrawHatter	Does anyone else get really confused by like, graphical representation of maths stuffs? 
2013-10-30 23:39:09	Sunstrike	Sometimes.
2013-10-30 23:39:15	Sunstrike	The diagrams aren't the best in that book
2013-10-30 23:39:25	Sunstrike	Or well… that book isn't the best book either :p

2013-11-02 17:17:45	StrawHatter	I have no idea what either of them are, but they both sound pretty rad

2013-11-03 13:43:05	StrawHatter	anyone know if anything is happening for the 5th?
2013-11-03 15:16:06	KitB	Doesn't look like there is anything this year, not by compsoc at least
2013-11-03 15:16:10	KitB	I could well be wrong.
2013-11-03 15:16:20	KitB	Compsoc *usually* does something for bonfire night

2013-11-03 15:23:40	KitB	Go out into Holyrood park and set off fireworks
2013-11-03 15:23:54	KitB	carefully, mind you; we aren't hooligans.
2013-11-03 15:40:47	StrawHatter	You say that, but really we're the most rebelious of all clubs at edinburgh 
2013-11-03 15:47:06	KitB	I'm pretty sure tea society is the most rebellious

2013-11-04 00:17:08	angusp	Mhhhh. If in doubt, cycle it out.
2013-11-04 00:25:37	hamhut	yep, all done it seems, will see after an hour or so of running without fail :p
2013-11-04 00:25:58	hamhut	what do you mean cycle it out?
2013-11-04 00:26:32	hamhut	apparently it's because of an epic program I use called unclutter

2013-11-04 11:28:32	StrawHatter	so um, is java any fun?
2013-11-04 11:28:41	KitB	It might be
2013-11-04 11:28:51	KitB	I find it horribly tedious and boring as languages go
2013-11-04 11:29:09	KitB	But you shouldn't really come up against any of the tedious bits during your course
2013-11-04 11:29:19	KitB	and it's a *very* good language in terms of usefulness
2013-11-04 11:29:35	StrawHatter	when you say tedious
2013-11-04 11:29:40	StrawHatter	what sorta stuffs are we talking?
2013-11-04 11:31:13	Sunstrike	Java is super verbose
2013-11-04 11:31:31	Sunstrike	If you want Java-like without so much verbosity you could check out Scala
2013-11-04 11:31:43	KitB	It's not so much verbosity
2013-11-04 11:31:46	KitB	though it has a bit of that
2013-11-04 11:31:55	KitB	(it's nothing like as bad as I remember Pascal being)
2013-11-04 11:32:02	Sunstrike	Pascal was horrific :p
2013-11-04 11:32:10	KitB	But in large systems you end up writing a lot of boilerplate code
2013-11-04 11:32:18	Sunstrike	But everyone loved it's assignment operator. :=
2013-11-04 11:32:20	StrawHatter	Isn't C quite verbose as well though?
2013-11-04 11:32:30	Sunstrike	C is verbose by requirement.
2013-11-04 11:32:31	KitB	= code that doesn't really do much but needs to be there
2013-11-04 11:32:41	KitB	I wouldn't call C verbose either
2013-11-04 11:32:50	Sunstrike	C is low-level compared to Java so you need more "stuff" to get somewhere
2013-11-04 11:33:00	KitB	Not necessarily
2013-11-04 11:33:05	KitB	See previous comment about boilerplate
2013-11-04 11:33:17	Sunstrike	Well, you need to map memory and such. It's not -verbose- as such, just technical
2013-11-04 11:33:18	StrawHatter	ohhh
2013-11-04 11:33:35	Sunstrike	I wouldn't recommend C as a starting language :P
2013-11-04 11:33:44	Sunstrike	That's like jumping in at the deep end
2013-11-04 11:34:04	KitB	I'm not sure there are many people who would recommend C as a starting language
2013-11-04 11:34:13	Sunstrike	I'd suggest starting with an interpreted language. Ruby/Python/Scala type languages.
2013-11-04 11:34:25	KitB	I'd suggest Python or Ruby
2013-11-04 11:34:28	KitB	I prefer Python
2013-11-04 11:34:28	Sunstrike	Scala would probably be wiser in your case as it's... Java-ish, which is good for Sem2
2013-11-04 11:34:54	Sunstrike	Also, if you do Python, get a -real- code editor like Sublime, or you may end up in a world of UnmatchedIndent agony
2013-11-04 11:35:15	StrawHatter	What did you guys start with?
2013-11-04 11:35:17	KitB	define "real"
2013-11-04 11:35:20	Sunstrike	I was a Ruby guy.
2013-11-04 11:35:28	Sunstrike	Real as in doesn't muddle your indents
2013-11-04 11:35:41	Sunstrike	I know Textmate used to mangle Python
2013-11-04 11:36:02	KitB	Languages I have learned, in order:
2013-11-04 11:36:10	Sunstrike	Because it's inferrence for "what tabs is this file using?" was awful. :p
2013-11-04 11:36:46	KitB	Javascript, Actionscript (back in a time before actionscript was just javascript), PHP, Pascal, Haskell, Java, Python, C/C++, various others in small amounts
2013-11-04 11:37:08	KitB	I wouldn't recommend that order
2013-11-04 11:37:33	KitB	Given a blank slate I'd recommend Python first
2013-11-04 11:37:38	Sunstrike	My full progression actually goes... (VB), ObjC, Ruby, (Pascal), Java, Scala.
2013-11-04 11:37:45	--	rob has changed topic for #compsoc from "COMPSOC <3 YOU (The website lives!) http://comp-soc.com/" to "COMPSOC <3 YOU (The website lives!) http://comp-soc.com/ | Usual fireworks mayhem planned for tues night, pm rob if you like blowing shit up..."
2013-11-04 11:37:49	Sunstrike	Ignore the brackets as I've purged them from memory :P
2013-11-04 11:38:07	StrawHatter	hue
2013-11-04 11:38:12	Sunstrike	I would recommend Ruby except it has it's oddities
2013-11-04 11:38:21	Sunstrike	Scala is closer to sem2's Java course
2013-11-04 11:38:36	Sunstrike	Python has whitespace-dependance which can bite you in the arse if you're not careful
2013-11-04 11:38:46	KitB	It really doesn't
2013-11-04 11:38:54	KitB	I mean it is whitespace sensitive
2013-11-04 11:39:09	Sunstrike	I always had problems with it. ALL the UnmatchedIndent errors. But that was when I used Textmate...
2013-11-04 11:39:14	KitB	But it really shouldn't ever cause trouble
2013-11-04 11:39:36	Sunstrike	I may try it again eventually. But right now Scala is my thing as most projects I'm doing need Java compat.
2013-11-04 11:39:38	KitB	Just set all tabs to be four spaces
2013-11-04 11:39:43	KitB	And you'll be fine
2013-11-04 11:39:49	Sunstrike	I did, TM stil ballsed it up :P
2013-11-04 11:39:51	StrawHatter	oi, i actually like VB...
2013-11-04 11:40:00	Sunstrike	VB teaches you evil evil things
2013-11-04 11:40:09	StrawHatter	but it's so kyute and cuddely <3
2013-11-04 11:40:09	KitB	(this is *the* standard for indentation in Python btw)
2013-11-04 11:40:23	KitB	StrawHatter: Please give an example
2013-11-04 11:40:25	Sunstrike	VB is evil. It should be purged. *nodnod*
2013-11-04 11:40:32	StrawHatter	w-whyyyyy
2013-11-04 11:40:34	KitB	Not StrawHatter, sorry
2013-11-04 11:40:36	KitB	My bad
2013-11-04 11:40:39	KitB	tab completion fail.
2013-11-04 11:40:43	KitB	Sunstrike: Please give an example

2013-11-04 11:40:53	Sunstrike	Err, been a while since I touched it, lemme see..
2013-11-04 11:41:01	StrawHatter	I actually really like VB If statements... 
2013-11-04 11:41:10	StrawHatter	please don't judge me </3
2013-11-04 11:41:35	Sunstrike	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/sect4ck6.aspx That notation is so out of line for most languages. It really... I dunno, doesn't prepare you for other languages

2013-11-04 11:41:56	StrawHatter	oh
2013-11-04 11:42:06	StrawHatter	Functions in VB were a nightmare to me
2013-11-04 11:42:29	Sunstrike	It's syntax is a tarpit. Someone once said that people who learn and stick to VB too long never recover :P
2013-11-04 11:42:33	StrawHatter	Mainly because my teacher couldn't teach it properly and I had to teach myself to do it :/
2013-11-04 11:42:54	Sunstrike	Thankfully all my HS lab PCs were in fact OS X so couldn't do VB
2013-11-04 11:42:57	KitB	Sunstrike: That person was Edgar Dijkstra and he was talking about a *very* different language to the one we have today
2013-11-04 11:43:19	Sunstrike	Eh. I still think it's too "out there" to be a good language to start with
2013-11-04 11:43:33	StrawHatter	Isn't Python on CodeAcademy?
2013-11-04 11:43:40	Sunstrike	Think so
2013-11-04 11:43:48	StrawHatter	I'd imagine that would make it a good place to start for a complete newcommer
2013-11-04 11:43:51	KitB	Any language that has the standard imperative constructions is fine
2013-11-04 11:44:18	KitB	(for the most part, I'd imagine there are examples one could give that disprove this general rule)
2013-11-04 11:44:58	KitB	http://programmingisterrible.com/post/40132515169/dijkstra-basic
2013-11-04 11:44:59	lambdabot	Title: Why did Dijkstra Hate Basic?—programming is terrible, http://tinyurl.com/oz6xjje
2013-11-04 11:45:10	Sunstrike	Yeah. In theory it'll teach you basic patterns, but I'd prefer to learn a language that is cross-platform and closer to "the norm"
2013-11-04 11:45:43	KitB	People enter programming from all sorts of routes
2013-11-04 11:45:45	StrawHatter	Is there a difference between Visual Basic and Basic? 
2013-11-04 11:45:49	Sunstrike	Yeah
2013-11-04 11:45:50	StrawHatter	Pls don't hurt me
2013-11-04 11:45:52	Sunstrike	A significant one
2013-11-04 11:45:55	StrawHatter	Like how bi-
2013-11-04 11:45:55	StrawHatter	oh
2013-11-04 11:45:59	Sunstrike	It's not nearly as bad as BASIC
2013-11-04 11:46:00	KitB	VB.NET is a modern language that is a perfectly viable route
2013-11-04 11:46:06	Jammy	KitB: Python became stricter on whitespace at some point
2013-11-04 11:46:14	Jammy	I think it was somewhere within the 2.6 series
2013-11-04 11:46:25	Jammy	which led to a bunch of libraries I was using at work suddenly failing
2013-11-04 11:46:28	StrawHatter	VB.NET is amazing
2013-11-04 11:46:34	StrawHatter	To me...
2013-11-04 11:46:57	KitB	Jammy: 2.7 was released in 2010 ?
2013-11-04 11:47:08	KitB	I'm aware they provide maintenance updates to 2.6 still
2013-11-04 11:47:18	Sunstrike	VB.NET is valid but I wouldn't recommend it in a month of sundays
2013-11-04 11:47:23	Jammy	we were using 2.7 :P
2013-11-04 11:47:34	Jammy	when the failure happened, I tried on the latest 2.6 too
2013-11-04 11:47:36	Jammy	still failed
2013-11-04 11:47:39	Jammy	then tried an earlier 2.6
2013-11-04 11:47:40	Jammy	worked
2013-11-04 11:47:49	Sunstrike	Python/Ruby is a safer and quicker entrypoint in my opinion
2013-11-04 11:47:51	KitB	They probably included the whitespace update in a patch to 2.6
2013-11-04 11:47:59	Jammy	I mean, I just submitted pull requests with all tabs changed to 4 spaces
2013-11-04 11:48:09	KitB	I'm sure the update to the libraries wasn't that hard
2013-11-04 11:48:13	Jammy	but to change something like that within a maintenance release?
2013-11-04 11:48:18	KitB	I agree, silly
2013-11-04 11:48:24	KitB	But I would blame cpython for that
2013-11-04 11:48:33	Jammy	also, you'd be surprised at how difficult it is to get some people to accept pull requests :P
2013-11-04 11:49:00	Jammy	I like Python, and I think being strict like this is good, but they should have done it from the start
2013-11-04 11:49:15	Jammy	it's amazing how things can look fine until you turn on some kind of whitespace visibility and then OH GOD
2013-11-04 11:49:49	StrawHatter	Imagine having Haskell as your first language...
2013-11-04 11:49:54	 *	StrawHatter shudders at the thought
2013-11-04 11:50:05	KitB	Having seen a lot of people go through that
2013-11-04 11:50:13	KitB	It's fine
2013-11-04 11:50:19	StrawHatter	it is?
2013-11-04 11:50:43	Jammy	I disagree with our reason for doing it like that
2013-11-04 11:51:04	Jammy	apparently it's to start everyone off on a more equal footing
2013-11-04 11:51:08	KitB	Yeah, it's kind of silly
2013-11-04 11:51:19	KitB	I'm pretty sure the real reason was Wadler wanted to
2013-11-04 11:51:22	KitB	or some shit like that
2013-11-04 11:51:25	Jammy	but I think it's easier for someone who's never programmed before to understand the concept of a for loop than a list comprehension for example
2013-11-04 11:51:36	StrawHatter	wait
2013-11-04 11:51:36	StrawHatter	are
2013-11-04 11:51:43	Jammy	but it seems to work ok
2013-11-04 11:51:51	StrawHatter	Lsit comprhensions supposed to be Haskells answer to For loops?! 
2013-11-04 11:51:58	Sunstrike	Yeah.
2013-11-04 11:52:01	StrawHatter	...
2013-11-04 11:52:02	KitB	StrawHatter: maps, LCs, recursion
2013-11-04 11:52:06	StrawHatter	I
2013-11-04 11:52:08	StrawHatter	Need a moment
2013-11-04 11:52:09	Sunstrike	they're simplified. But yes. Kind of.
2013-11-04 11:52:20	KitB	Haskell doesn't have an "answer to for loops"
2013-11-04 11:52:23	Jammy	they are insanely powerful once you get to know them
2013-11-04 11:52:36	Jammy	but to try and learn them so soon after learning to program at all?
2013-11-04 11:52:39	Sunstrike	It's equivalent to say... "for (Item i : List) { doThing(i); }"
2013-11-04 11:52:40	KitB	Haskell has a variety of more powerful mechanisms for repeated computation
2013-11-04 11:52:43	Jammy	man, I feel sorry for the people that go through that
2013-11-04 11:52:49	KitB	Sunstrike: Not quite true
2013-11-04 11:52:54	StrawHatter	... Okay
2013-11-04 11:52:56	Sunstrike	Roughly speaking, not precisely
2013-11-04 11:53:00	StrawHatter	I think Haskell has just
2013-11-04 11:53:05	StrawHatter	Gotten easier
2013-11-04 11:53:15	StrawHatter	I just thought it was something you did
2013-11-04 11:53:31	Sunstrike	It's kind of like that Java snippet. But optionally can filter too. And has other tricks.
2013-11-04 11:53:32	Jammy	you'll learn to love list comprehensions
2013-11-04 11:53:45	Jammy	soon you'll be using them in python and ruby and stuff too
2013-11-04 11:53:50	Jammy	they're just so goddam beautiful
2013-11-04 11:54:02	Sunstrike	Now. I'm gunna head for the GS LT.
2013-11-04 11:54:05	Sunstrike	o/
2013-11-04 11:54:38	KitB	Jammy: Not to mention set, dict, and generator comprehensions (in Python at least)

2013-11-04 11:56:23	Jammy	he still didn't ask for the full Alpen
2013-11-04 11:56:38	KitB	Did he get confused because of jet lag from a one hour time difference?
2013-11-04 11:56:45	Jammy	probably
2013-11-04 11:56:52	StrawHatter	Um, I don't wanna sound rude or anything but.. Who's Depr?
2013-11-04 11:56:56	Jammy	he also still isn't addicted to cowbells
2013-11-04 11:56:59	rob	ahhh fuck. forgot my laptop PSU
2013-11-04 11:57:05	Jammy	but he has taken to injecting fondue
2013-11-04 11:57:19	Jammy	directly into the veins
2013-11-04 11:57:30	Jammy	StrawHatter: Come to the pub tonight and you will meet him
2013-11-04 11:57:30	KitB	StrawHatter: A friend of ours called David. He graduated over the summer
2013-11-04 11:57:33	KitB	Just like Jammy did

2013-11-04 11:57:52	Jammy	probably
2013-11-04 11:58:08	KitB	StrawHatter: He's kinda Derpy
2013-11-04 11:58:11	StrawHatter	But I can't get into the pub :c
2013-11-04 11:58:17	KitB	You totally can
2013-11-04 11:58:23	StrawHatter	I totally can?
2013-11-04 11:58:32	KitB	When we say pub
2013-11-04 11:58:34	StrawHatter	I got told that 17 year olds can't pub though
2013-11-04 11:58:36	KitB	we mean the Auld Hoose
2013-11-04 11:58:44	StrawHatter	Auld Hoose?
2013-11-04 11:58:54	KitB	and you can come in and eat and talk without having any alcohol
2013-11-04 11:58:59	Jammy	it is a special magical pub

2013-11-04 12:00:39	KitB	About having assignment code in public repos
2013-11-04 12:00:55	KitB	Which is apparently banned by the plagiarism regulations
2013-11-04 12:01:06	KitB	(a very careful reading of the page says it's not but that's not the point)
2013-11-04 12:01:18	KitB	It might just be personalised search

2013-11-04 12:01:42	Jammy	he's just a github shill

2013-11-04 12:02:20	KitB	Care to tell me if that actually precludes putting code into public repos
2013-11-04 12:02:21	KitB	?
2013-11-04 12:02:31	KitB	I mean obviously in the spirit of the thing it would

2013-11-04 12:03:14	KitB	Oh damn
2013-11-04 12:03:17	KitB	I must have missed that
2013-11-04 12:03:24	Jammy	I think it's a bit silly really
2013-11-04 12:03:34	KitB	Indeed
2013-11-04 12:04:16	Jammy	I should flip all of my coursework repos to public now
2013-11-04 12:04:22	Jammy	what are they gonna do about THAT?
2013-11-04 12:04:23	KitB	I agree
2013-11-04 12:04:24	Jammy	HA!
2013-11-04 12:04:45	Jammy	print out many copies and rain them down from the sky
2013-11-04 12:04:56	KitB	If I can be arsed/remember to I'll probably switch all of mine back to public when I graduate
2013-11-04 12:07:56	KitB	Jammy: could you check my bitbucket page for public repos pls?

2013-11-04 12:32:20	KitB	unfortunately not
2013-11-04 12:32:31	KitB	If you want to use git for it
2013-11-04 12:32:37	KitB	I'd suggest you use bitbucket
2013-11-04 12:32:42	KitB	so you can have private repos
2013-11-04 12:32:59	angusp	But we dont get credit for haskell tutorials
2013-11-04 12:33:05	ball-hayden	Or use informatics
2013-11-04 12:33:12	ball-hayden	And have a git folder there
2013-11-04 12:33:21	ball-hayden	git init --bare git/something.git
2013-11-04 12:33:47	ball-hayden	then git clone sxxxxxxx@ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:git/something.git
2013-11-04 12:34:05	KitB	angusp: Tutorials I would call a grey area
2013-11-04 12:34:27	KitB	ball-hayden: I mean that works and all
2013-11-04 12:34:45	KitB	But I'd much rather be able to use key authentication
2013-11-04 12:35:24	angusp	KitB: ill just email them and ask. I think there are about 4 inf1 haskell public repos on github
2013-11-04 12:35:51	KitB	Well I know that Jacob's repo from his first year was public a couple of weeks ago
2013-11-04 12:36:04	KitB	Because a could of my tutees informed me that they had received help from it
2013-11-04 12:36:12	KitB	s/could/souple/g
2013-11-04 12:36:22	KitB	seriously what's going on with my typing?
2013-11-04 12:36:28	KitB	s/souple/couple/g
2013-11-04 12:38:24	ball-hayden	Kerberos if you're that bothered? It's much quicker to push to informatics than bitbucket. Like, stupidly fast.
2013-11-04 12:38:46	KitB	I haven't ever had issue with the speed of pushing to bitbucket
2013-11-04 12:39:47	ball-hayden	True.

2013-11-04 14:58:46	R2ZER0	no, it's just the tuesday social, pub meetup, but we could always alter it a bit
2013-11-04 14:58:49	Jammy	assuming your school rep is worth his salt
2013-11-04 14:58:50	StrawHatter	we can bring people from outside uni right? :/
2013-11-04 14:58:56	 *	Sunstrike hides from caleidhs at all times.

2013-11-04 14:59:06	MKBandit	I AM UP FOR THIS. BOMBFIRE NIGHT CEILIDH GO
2013-11-04 14:59:11	Jammy	Sunstrike: The inf one is fun!
2013-11-04 14:59:16	hamhut	sunstrike, why!! they're awesome
2013-11-04 14:59:18	Sunstrike	I hate dance
2013-11-04 14:59:22	Jammy	there is food and drinks and nobody can dance
2013-11-04 14:59:24	R2ZER0	uhh, ceilidh, sure why not
2013-11-04 14:59:25	StrawHatter	MKBandit: What if I said.... Bonfire Night Ceilidh at Deep Sea World?
2013-11-04 14:59:29	hamhut	meh, who doesn't but meh
2013-11-04 14:59:32	Jammy	so it just turns into us spinning people as fast as possible

2013-11-04 14:59:55	Jammy	R2ZER0: To do one properly costs a fortune
2013-11-04 14:59:58	Jammy	just leave it to inf
2013-11-04 14:59:59	angusp	tbf caleidhs are harder to spell than dance at, if the fresher's ball is a good reference
2013-11-04 15:00:06	hamhut	Jammy, this is how to ceilight

2013-11-04 15:00:34	StrawHatter	Kinda flawed your statement MKBandit <3
2013-11-04 15:00:35	Jammy	if compsoc do one, then inf might decide that the £1500 a year cost of running theirs isn't worth it
2013-11-04 15:00:36	 *	MKBandit doesn't even lift
2013-11-04 15:00:39	hamhut	mkbandit, seems we can't even do that

2013-11-04 15:01:23	StrawHatter	Oh... In that case, yeah, let the INf people run it
2013-11-04 15:01:32	StrawHatter	I still demand a trip to Deep Sea World though...
2013-11-04 15:01:54	R2ZER0	wtf is deep sea world? and where is it?
