2013-11-04 00:19:15	hamhut1	anyone on? I have an xmonad/dzen2 problem. My  xmonad randomly (I haven't yet found a cause) hangs. The only way to fix it is with a second dzen I have running, I have set a clickable space that does 'killall dzen2 && xmonad --recompile && xmonad --restart'
2013-11-04 00:20:30	geekosaur	99% of unexpained hangs are covered by http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#XMonad_stops_but_the_current_window_still_responds_to_keys
2013-11-04 00:20:46	geekosaur	(unless you use unclutter, in which case it's very likely to involve that)
2013-11-04 00:21:00	hamhut1	ah, I use unclutter
2013-11-04 00:21:46	geekosaur	unclutter breaks a whole bunch of rules and can potentially cause any window manager to hang, but xmonad and dwm are especially vulnerable to tripping over it
2013-11-04 00:21:53	geekosaur	http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#XMonad_stops_responding_to_keys_.28usually_due_to_unclutter.29

2013-11-04 02:57:12	Plouj-	Just upgraded to Ubuntu Saucy and for some reason mod-space doesn't switch layouts anymore. Any clues?
2013-11-04 03:03:36	geekosaur	something else is probably grabbing it. I haven't figured out what's grabbing mod-p on my SL6+Xfce yet...
2013-11-04 03:06:13	Plouj-	Interestingly, other mod-* key combinations still work
2013-11-04 03:06:25	Plouj-	Which makes me think it's not exactly this problem: http://askubuntu.com/questions/113207/cant-bind-gnome-do-to-super-space-or-ctrlaltspace
2013-11-04 03:06:28	--	Plouj- is now known as Plouj
2013-11-04 03:12:35	geekosaur	right, but there are other possibilities. one that comes to mind is that something has grabbed it to switch keyboard layouts or something

2013-11-04 14:49:31	geekosaur	I think they're asking about which jvm, not which window manager
2013-11-04 14:49:36	Rockj	I guess it would be metacity if I haven't had a .xsession.
2013-11-04 14:49:43	Rockj	oh
2013-11-04 14:50:15	geekosaur	but .xsession ignores all the gnomey session manager stuff completely (unless you run gnome-session in it) so you're getting the window manager you run in there

2013-11-04 14:53:05	geekosaur	beyond versions, there's oracle, openjdk, and IBM's implementation
2013-11-04 14:53:34	geekosaur	openjdk is the one that plays best with non-reparenting window managers (provided you set the environment variable)
2013-11-04 14:54:19	geekosaur	IBM's is rather buggy so not very widely used
2013-11-04 14:54:56	Rockj	yeah, but my experience is that PyCharm only works with JDK1.6 from oracle
2013-11-04 14:55:09	Rockj	at least earlier it was a known bug with jdk7 and xmonad

2013-11-04 14:57:00	Rockj	same result with JDK6 and 7 from Oracle
2013-11-04 14:57:05	Rockj	and with OpenJDK it just crashes
2013-11-04 14:58:56	Rockj	geekosaur: I normally run gnome-session with xmonad, and disable the panels so I get gksudo , audio controls etc.
2013-11-04 14:59:23	Rockj	but atm I'm just trying to get my xmonad up and running as it should with java and normal running of gnome applications
2013-11-04 14:59:44	Rockj	which means I have to run gnome-settings-daemon or what it is my self to ensure I get some settings the gnome apps is looking for
2013-11-04 15:00:29	geekosaur	ok. the x-window-manager thing is just gnome declaring its default window manager, except in the display manager session config which is where a gnome+xmonad session would specify that it is using xmonad as the window manager component
2013-11-04 15:02:24	Rockj	but it looks like #8 have gotten it to work tho, so I'm rather curious now.
2013-11-04 15:02:52	Rockj	I'll go fetch latest JDK7, incase its fixed in some late late revision of jdk7

2013-11-04 15:42:04	plotr	oo_miguel: I usually just grab some window with mouse and pull it whenever I like
2013-11-04 15:42:43	oo_miguel	plotr: It wokrs for me usually. but I have a java-websart window which does not work, I think its some buggy implementation
2013-11-04 15:43:01	oo_miguel	and the content of the window is not properly displayed under xmonad
2013-11-04 15:43:11	oo_miguel	while it works in convetnional window managers
2013-11-04 15:43:37	plotr	ahh, java is always a pain - the for some reason completely fail to follow standards
2013-11-04 15:43:38	oo_miguel	What if I want the window to initialize in its "desired" dimensions
2013-11-04 15:44:24	oo_miguel	plotr: Do you think its javas fault? or bad ui design of the app in question?
2013-11-04 15:44:34	Rockj	oo_miguel: which jvm do you use? and which libgtk3 do you have?
2013-11-04 15:44:35	plotr	I would try to grab window properties through xprop and add it to exclusion list which gets doFloat by default
2013-11-04 15:44:53	geekosaur	oo_miguel, java doesn't work quite right with non-reparenting window managers, see http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions#Preferred_Method
2013-11-04 15:45:13	oo_miguel	Rockj: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.3.10) (7u25-2.3.10-1~deb7u1)
2013-11-04 15:45:45	oo_miguel	i A libgtk-3-0
2013-11-04 15:46:00	geekosaur	also java doesnt have useful window properties as the AWT exposes no way to set even WM_CLASS much less others
2013-11-04 15:46:09	geekosaur	(yet another way java is noncompliant with standards)
2013-11-04 15:46:25	oo_miguel	ill ahve a look at the link geekosaur gave me.
2013-11-04 15:46:29	oo_miguel	thank you everybody
2013-11-04 15:46:57	Rockj	oo_miguel: do that, should be an environment variable you should set which openjdk respects and helps the drawing of java ui if I understand it correctly.
2013-11-04 15:47:09	Rockj	all in the faq. :]
2013-11-04 15:47:44	geekosaur	that's what I pointed to
2013-11-04 15:48:09	geekosaur	things would be so much easier if AWT weren't completely derp
2013-11-04 15:48:26	Rockj	:-/
2013-11-04 15:48:27	oo_miguel	wow
2013-11-04 15:48:44	oo_miguel	with _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1  it works like a dream :)
2013-11-04 15:49:02	oo_miguel	I did not believe this will really work ;) thanks a lot again

2013-11-04 16:03:06	geekosaur	oh sigh, that should not be doing the setWMName...
2013-11-04 16:03:25	creek	maybe tail the auth log could be nice to have running on the desktop.
2013-11-04 16:03:28	geekosaur	didn't we learn better than that (setting it every logHook run) back in 0.9???
2013-11-04 16:03:46	Rockj	geekosaur: but it mentions about it being merged in issue 177?
2013-11-04 16:03:53	Rockj	maybe it's depricated stuff , hm
2013-11-04 16:04:13	geekosaur	no, the setWMname in every loghook was a bug in the original EwmhDesktops
2013-11-04 16:04:32	geekosaur	apparently we reintroduced it in takeTopFocus, sigh

2013-11-04 16:06:12	Rockj	I should probably remove the import anyway, but #123 at least confirms what my experience have been
2013-11-04 16:06:22	Rockj	that's it only been working for JDK 1.6 from oracle.
2013-11-04 16:07:22	Rockj	confusing, I'll remove the import (since takeTopFocus is shipped in contrib if I understand this correctly) and see if it still causes gtk3 being meh.
