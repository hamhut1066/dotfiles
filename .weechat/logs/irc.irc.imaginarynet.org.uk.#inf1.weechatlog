2013-10-09 14:55:50	dcspaul	would you expect this to be the same for all n ? ... decrypt n (encrypt n "hum")
2013-10-09 15:05:30	@ChrisB	No... the string has fewer than 5 characters, so the splitEachFive adds in 'X's to make a block of 5. The cipher of those Xs then depends on the rotation number...
2013-10-09 15:06:41	@ChrisB	so it's true for all n only when your string length is a multiple of 5
2013-10-09 15:11:17	dcspaul	I think I'm asking a slightly different question - I can see that encrypt and decrypt are not inverses for the reasomn you give, but ...
2013-10-09 15:12:21	dcspaul	decrypt 5 (encrypt 5 "foo") ... and ... decrypt 6 (encrypt 6 "foo")
2013-10-09 15:16:31	@ChrisB	I think I was answering that slightly different question too :) The 'X's introduced by splitEachFive are not removed before deciphering, so the character they are deciphered to depends on n.
2013-10-09 15:19:54	@ChrisB	(splitEachFive is applied after enciphering)
2013-10-09 15:20:35	@ChrisB	I agree it's not the behaviour one would expect "in the real world", but it simplifies the exercise, I guess.
2013-10-09 15:20:54	@ChrisB	Sorry, I have to go. Drop me an email if you still have questions.

2013-10-09 15:21:51	dcspaul	no - thats fine - thanks! it just seemed like an undesirable property, but fixing it would involve doing things in a different order ...

2013-10-09 15:32:40	Damodar	Hi there! I am struggling with exercise 2 for tutorial 2 I have made something like that : makeKey value = [ ( y , x ) | y <- ['A'..'Z'] , x <- rotate value ['A'..'Z'] , digitToInt y + 2 == digitToInt x   ]
2013-10-09 15:32:54	Damodar	where rotate is : rotate number list = drop number list ++ take number list
2013-10-09 15:33:20	Damodar	but when I want to make it work : *Main> makeKey 2
2013-10-09 15:33:20	Damodar	*** Exception: Char.digitToInt: not a digit 'G'
2013-10-09 15:33:36	Damodar	any idea?
2013-10-09 15:39:22	dcspaul	digitToInt takes a single character representing a digit (eg. '0' or '7)
2013-10-09 15:40:12	dcspaul	you are applying it to y which ranges over all of the letters 'A' .. 'Z'
2013-10-09 15:41:02	dcspaul	it is actually failing on the 'G' (rather than the 'A') because it also understands the hexademical digits 'A' (10) through 'F' (15)
2013-10-09 15:41:47	dcspaul	does that make sense ?
2013-10-09 15:53:17	Damodar	Yeah thanks!
2013-10-09 15:54:59	Damodar	So which function should I use to convert letter to number? Or how can I filter results of my makeKey function so that only pairs like ( A , A+ value ) will be given?
2013-10-09 15:56:31	Damodar	I feel that my idea isn't really stright forwards soution, rather a tricky one.
2013-10-09 16:00:09	Damodar	i figured out that I should use ord function, and it is working, but still that is a tricky solution, is there any better one?

2013-10-10 13:43:22	Nakura	anybody here?
2013-10-10 13:43:41	@KitB	yes
2013-10-10 13:44:55	Nakura	I've got a question about the last compulsory exercise of this week's tutorial
2013-10-10 13:45:02	Nakura	11
2013-10-10 13:45:21	@KitB	Go ahead
2013-10-10 13:46:55	Nakura	well, basically, this is my code for this exercise, it doesn't work and I don't know how to improve it:
2013-10-10 13:48:08	Nakura	candidates xs = [(n, decipherStr n xs)|n<-[1..26],(contains "AND" (decipherStr n xs) || contains "THE" (decipherStr n xs))]
2013-10-10 13:48:49	@KitB	you are using "contains" the wrong way around
2013-10-10 13:49:00	@KitB	it should be:
2013-10-10 13:49:12	@KitB	...contains (decipherStr n xs) "AND" ...
2013-10-10 13:49:30	@KitB	this is made a bit more obvious if you use the backtick notation for contains
2013-10-10 13:49:34	@KitB	so I would have
2013-10-10 13:49:47	@KitB	... (decipherStr n xs) `contains` "AND" ...
2013-10-10 13:50:14	Nakura	ok you're right
2013-10-10 13:51:55	Nakura	god it works
2013-10-10 13:53:03	Nakura	except that when I include the condition for n>(length xs) in the first exercise for the definition of rotate
2013-10-10 13:53:29	Nakura	my candidates function works, but it also includes my error message
2013-10-10 13:54:11	Nakura	is there a way to avoid that?
2013-10-10 13:54:48	@KitB	That will be because you are using n <- [1..26]
2013-10-10 13:54:54	@KitB	so it will eventually have the value 26
2013-10-10 13:55:16	@KitB	> len ['A'..'Z']
2013-10-10 13:55:18	lambdabot	  Not in scope: `len'
2013-10-10 13:55:18	lambdabot	 Perhaps you meant `lex' (imported from Prelude)
2013-10-10 13:55:23	@KitB	> length ['A'..'Z']
2013-10-10 13:55:23	lambdabot	  26
2013-10-10 13:55:58	@KitB	I use [1..25]
2013-10-10 13:56:15	@KitB	Can you tell me which case this misses?
2013-10-10 13:57:28	Nakura	the 26th case, which would be... [(A,A), (B,B) (...)], right?
2013-10-10 13:57:48	@KitB	Indeed
2013-10-10 13:58:01	@KitB	So in terms of decryption, what would this miss?
2013-10-10 13:58:06	Nakura	so if you put an uncoded message
2013-10-10 13:58:19	@KitB	Indeed
2013-10-10 13:58:22	Nakura	your function will not find a key to it
