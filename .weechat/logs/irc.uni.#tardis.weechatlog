2013-10-31 13:22:33	angusp	Is there anyone in/near AT that I can give an application form to?

2013-10-31 13:33:42	ball-hayden	Grr. I was there then. Not there now. Sorry.
2013-10-31 13:34:09	ball-hayden	I'll be in AT again at 16:00 if you are still around?
2013-10-31 13:34:45	ball-hayden	Jammy: I'm blind. Yes, there is still one there.
2013-10-31 13:37:50	ball-hayden	We have 12(?) boxes, but I suspect a second one wouldn't do much good unless it had cables long enough to reach the top/bottom of the rack.

2013-10-31 14:06:14	Jammy	Hmmmmm
2013-10-31 14:06:20	Jammy	Ok, I won't bring one at the moment
2013-10-31 14:06:47	Jammy	but if we get a patch panel at some point, then I can probably grab a second one then
2013-10-31 14:16:01	ball-hayden	Thanks.
2013-10-31 14:44:12	Jammy	soooooooo
2013-10-31 14:44:29	Jammy	have you used any IOS stuff so far?
2013-10-31 14:44:54	Jammy	i.e. will you be able to set this up yourself, or should we arrange sometime I can bring it over and do the initial config?
2013-10-31 14:48:20	angusp	ball-hayden: Yeah, could be there at 16:00. Where in AT is the tardis?
2013-10-31 15:16:05	Jammy	angusp: It's on AT5, in a room just off lab west
2013-10-31 15:16:11	Jammy	front right corner
2013-10-31 15:19:20	angusp	Jammy: Though it was there
2013-10-31 15:19:44	Jammy	if he hasn't seen my question by then, can you ask him about it?
2013-10-31 15:20:05	Jammy	I should be free to come and set it up any time outside office hours if he needs a hand
2013-10-31 15:22:19	angusp	Yeah, just sitting in the lab because it's locked atm
2013-10-31 15:22:49	Jammy	cheers homeboy
2013-10-31 15:22:55	Jammy	you should come along too!
2013-10-31 15:22:58	Jammy	get involved
2013-10-31 15:23:05	Jammy	the more the merrier
2013-10-31 15:23:12	Jammy	especially once we have our cloud
2013-10-31 15:24:11	Jammy	speaking of cloud...
2013-10-31 15:24:56	angusp	Could get involved... btw I have a poweredge lying around doing nothing
2013-10-31 15:25:03	Jammy	anybody have any computers that support VT-d or AMD-Vi to donate?

2013-11-01 13:20:33	hamhut	yeah, I'll do that, I almost printed them yesterday but I forgot to go to the printer
2013-11-01 13:27:51	ball-hayden	Don't forget the uni computing regulations as well
2013-11-01 13:51:06	hamhut	yep, will do
2013-11-01 15:12:33	joe	looks like we've started looking for interns and graduates
2013-11-01 15:13:48	joe	anybody want to work for Cisco?
2013-11-01 15:13:54	joe	(that Jammy hasn't already spoken to)
2013-11-01 15:14:12	Jammy	apparently I'm also now doing an STMU talk
2013-11-01 15:14:35	Jammy	I stupidly mentioned that I was thinking of doing one to Andy on Wednesday and now he's told me I have to
2013-11-01 15:14:55	Jammy	if something's broke, don't mention it's broke because you'll get dragged in to fixing it
2013-11-01 15:16:59	joe	when?
2013-11-01 15:17:10	Jammy	29th of this month apparently
2013-11-01 15:17:12	joe	mine is at the end of the month
2013-11-01 15:17:16	joe	:D
2013-11-01 15:17:18	Jammy	wat
2013-11-01 15:17:20	joe	same!
2013-11-01 15:17:21	Jammy	uh oh
2013-11-01 15:17:24	Jammy	what's yours about
2013-11-01 15:17:27	joe	TDD
2013-11-01 15:17:31	Jammy	I'm not 100% decided yet
2013-11-01 15:17:40	joe	basically the same as I did in the office
2013-11-01 15:17:46	Jammy	I started at computers and have narrowed it down to networks so far
2013-11-01 15:18:03	Jammy	maybe I'll narrow it down further to internet or even IPv6
2013-11-01 15:18:10	joe	I've always thought "lol, networks" might make for an interesting talk
2013-11-01 15:18:19	Jammy	I like IPv6 because it has big numbers
2013-11-01 15:18:26	joe	wires -> hubs -> switches -> routers
2013-11-01 15:18:46	@bacam	Jammy: Good intro line for a talk, that
2013-11-01 15:18:56	Jammy	wires -> wires -> wires -> glass wires
2013-11-01 15:21:35	Jammy	bacam: How about "18 quintillion addresses should be enough for anyone"?
2013-11-01 15:22:16	Jammy	wait
2013-11-01 15:22:55	angusp	ball-hayden: Yeah, filled it in but you lot are never in
2013-11-01 15:23:51	Jammy	I seem to remember seeing something about the recommended allocation being like /56 per customer now rather than /64
2013-11-01 15:26:48	angusp	Is anyone in AT now? Or can I just put the form under the door?
2013-11-01 15:28:11	ball-hayden	I'm in LT3 at the moment. I'm running off to the train station at 15:45, so if you catch me then...
2013-11-01 15:34:06	angusp	Where's LT3? Im in AT 5.05
2013-11-01 15:34:16	angusp	Oh. Lecture Theatre. Doh
