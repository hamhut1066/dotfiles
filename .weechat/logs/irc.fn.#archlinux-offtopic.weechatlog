2013-10-10 18:42:10	dowaat	hekel: no one has called you a faggot. Several have called you stupid
2013-10-10 18:42:11	dunz0r	dowaat: If you have the skills, repair it yourself :)
2013-10-10 18:42:23	dowaat	calling you stupid != faggot, and calling you stupid isn't an insult its an observation.
2013-10-10 18:42:24	hekel	Oct 07 23:03:16 <CookieJar>	hekel, everyone on the internet calls each other a faggot
2013-10-10 18:42:24	hekel	Oct 07 23:03:19 <CookieJar>	you faggot
2013-10-10 18:42:28	demize	hekel: Seriously, go troll elsewhere
2013-10-10 18:42:38	nathan28_offace	hey guys check this out: /ignore

2013-10-10 18:42:40	Tom^	secondly who the fuck cares, its irc man

2013-10-10 18:43:04	CookieJar	hekel, as I mentioned at the time, that second line isn't a serious insult
2013-10-10 18:43:09	dunz0r	dowaat: Might ofc not be the same where you live as it is here, but >2 months is a bit much
2013-10-10 18:43:16	CookieJar	isn't meant to be*
2013-10-10 18:43:31	nathan28_offace	the /ignore is the poor man's kickban
2013-10-10 18:43:38	nathan28_offace	don't get me wrong if i was ops it'd be a slaughter
2013-10-10 18:43:38	hekel	CookieJar, oh, ok.. I didn't find it insulting.. because you tell me not to?
2013-10-10 18:43:40	dowaat	dunz0r: i have an insurance policy on the device
2013-10-10 18:43:48	dowaat	which allows me to swap it and pay a deductible
2013-10-10 18:43:50	nathan28_offace	dowaat: you bought lolsurance on a lolphone
2013-10-10 18:44:01	dowaat	nathan28_offace: yup, i break them at excessively alarming rates
2013-10-10 18:44:01	nathan28_offace	how many accidental/damage swaps do you get
2013-10-10 18:44:04	dunz0r	dowaat: Nice. I only have a repair-deal.
2013-10-10 18:44:06	MrElendig	hekel: there were no ops present at the times you posted in the pastebin from what I can see
2013-10-10 18:44:15	dowaat	2 or 3 a year, not positive
2013-10-10 18:44:21	nathan28_offace	crapple was 2 'accidental' and unlimited OEM failure for one year iirc
2013-10-10 18:44:24	nathan28_offace	on ipads
2013-10-10 18:44:24	MrElendig	hekel: and please back up your claim that the ops have called people faggots
2013-10-10 18:44:36	dowaat	dunz0r: repairs would be too slow
2013-10-10 18:44:40	dowaat	that would force me back to an SGSII
2013-10-10 18:44:57	nathan28_offace	dowaat: join the devolution and go back to a burner dumfone
2013-10-10 18:45:13	MrElendig	the closest thing I can find is one instance by wizzo, but wizzo is not an op
2013-10-10 18:45:18	MrElendig	(he used to be)
2013-10-10 18:45:23	dowaat	dunz0r: with warranty you pay, they ship the replacement ,you ship the broken one back
2013-10-10 18:45:30	dowaat	the screen isn't inoperable its just quite banged up
2013-10-10 18:45:34	dowaat	took a literal chip out of the corner
2013-10-10 18:45:39	dunz0r	Mine was completely inoperable
2013-10-10 18:45:46	dowaat	dunz0r: i got out of my truck and forgot it was on my lap
2013-10-10 18:45:49	dowaat	went bouncing down the road
2013-10-10 18:45:55	nathan28_offace	dowaat: lol, get an htc
2013-10-10 18:46:00	dunz0r	I could press the middle if I pressed hard on the top left, but that's it.
2013-10-10 18:46:04	nathan28_offace	they suck but you can pretty much throw them across a room
2013-10-10 18:46:09	CookieJar	hekel, even without me saying after, I felt it was obvious it was meant as a joke
2013-10-10 18:46:10	hekel	MrElendig, whatever, ok.. you know as well as I do that I've told you on several occasions that I LOG NOTHING... untill the past 2 weeks or so, because My complaints to you and other ops about people using hate speech against me have been met with resistance and denial
2013-10-10 18:46:14	nathan28_offace	terrible at making calls, great at stopping bullets
2013-10-10 18:46:15	dowaat	nathan28_offace: I've broken a number of HTC devices
2013-10-10 18:46:19	dowaat	the only HTC device still alive is my nexus 1
2013-10-10 18:46:23	nathan28_offace	dowaat: okay you're rough on phones then
2013-10-10 18:46:24	CookieJar	especially since my third line was " >_> "
2013-10-10 18:46:24	dowaat	which is now a defacto directv remote

2013-10-10 18:46:46	dowaat	MrElendig: can we call it to a vote?
2013-10-10 18:46:50	nathan28_offace	MrElendig: you need more special regex
2013-10-10 18:46:51	dowaat	lets just have a vote on him
2013-10-10 18:46:54	MrElendig	hekel: I have not denied  it
2013-10-10 18:46:54	hekel	MrElendig, you win.. I get it.. if I have a problem with being called a faggot, etc.. then I need to leave Freenode because you refuse to do anything about it
2013-10-10 18:46:55	dunz0r	dowaat: I just picked mine out of my pocket and dropped it on to asphalt, it landed perfectly on one the corners, which is why the screen cracked all the way over.
2013-10-10 18:46:59	dowaat	we'll cave to democratic proceedings for one day.
2013-10-10 18:47:06	hekel	MrElendig, I said a op did it in June

2013-10-10 19:24:41	carharttjimmy	thats because there are no norwegian workers, you hire imigrants to do it all

2013-10-10 19:24:51	rmd	there should be a huge gap between people who live on government funds and those who don't. the issue is that minimum wage doesn't really provide enough to survive, esp with insurance/healthcare isn't very-well provided.
2013-10-10 19:24:58	MrElendig	most follow the minimum tarrif negosiated between the unions though

2013-10-10 19:25:52	dowaat	just throw that there
2013-10-10 19:26:07	dowaat	MrElendig: tipped has to show proof that they make sustainable gross income off tips, btw
2013-10-10 19:26:14	dowaat	you cannot count a subway worker as a tipped employee, example.
2013-10-10 19:26:25	MrElendig	dowaat: I know of the tipped system
2013-10-10 19:26:33	rmd	colar-lol-do
2013-10-10 19:26:34	dowaat	you seem to know very little of our pay system
2013-10-10 19:26:40	dowaat	you think you know a lot, which is okay
2013-10-10 19:26:48	MrElendig	dowaat: only legal to pay that if the net income will be higher than the normal minimum wage btw
2013-10-10 19:26:57	carharttjimmy	.....
2013-10-10 19:27:02	rmd	what's funny is that dowaat seems to assume that if the legislation is in place, it's normal practice.
2013-10-10 19:27:09	carharttjimmy	dowaat: clearly he knows more about America than we actually do.
2013-10-10 19:27:14	dowaat	did you know...
2013-10-10 19:27:15	rmd	cause i worked in a lot of restaurants, and getting them to pay the diff wasn't easy.
2013-10-10 19:27:25	dowaat	in car sales and car finance, you are paid minimum wage?
2013-10-10 19:27:26	MrElendig	and ofcourse there are lots of exceptions
2013-10-10 19:27:32	dowaat	you receive a 30 day advance on it at the start of each month
2013-10-10 19:27:40	dowaat	and then when you make back min ++ you pay it back and keep whatever else
2013-10-10 19:27:41	rmd	in some places
2013-10-10 19:27:45	rmd	yes, but not all
2013-10-10 19:27:47	MrElendig	that pic says that you can't discriminate based on religion/race etc
2013-10-10 19:27:55	dowaat	EG, if you were paid 1600 in draw you had to earn 1600++ to break ahead of base draw
2013-10-10 19:27:56	MrElendig	but that doesn't apply if you are a religious institution
2013-10-10 19:27:59	MrElendig	^_^
2013-10-10 19:28:35	taotetek	I heard that Norway throws the elderly into the North Sea to reduce their tax burden.

2013-10-10 19:29:31	MrElendig	anyway, the quality of our elder homes etc varies a lot
2013-10-10 19:29:37	rmd	dowaat: did you just have the world's shorted visit from osha?
2013-10-10 19:29:41	MrElendig	in bergen where I live they fucking suck
2013-10-10 19:29:43	rmd	shortest*
2013-10-10 19:30:05	MrElendig	I've told my parents that if/when they someday have to go to a elder home, they have to move first
2013-10-10 19:30:09	taotetek	MrElendig: here we just let them wander around talking to themselves until they die from exposure if their family members can't take care of them.
2013-10-10 19:30:19	MrElendig	because the ones here in bergen is overpopulated, underfunded and understaffed
2013-10-10 19:30:29	MrElendig	and I've actually worked at them all

2013-10-10 19:32:22	MrElendig	here in bergen, the old ones can end up literally sitting in their own shit for 12h until the staff take the next round
2013-10-10 19:32:48	MrElendig	because they are so understaffed that they don't have time to do anything but the rounds and any medical emergencies
2013-10-10 19:32:54	MrElendig	it is so fucked up

2013-10-10 19:33:28	dowaat	MrElendig: the NLRA gives all americans the right to unionize
2013-10-10 19:33:33	dowaat	the great part is americans are morons and CHOOSE not to
2013-10-10 19:33:42	dowaat	if my staff decided to unionize I have to sit back like a bitch and take it
2013-10-10 19:33:50	rmd	lol

2013-10-10 19:34:21	dowaat	MrElendig: people do not try to
2013-10-10 19:34:26	MrElendig	also most of the large unions in usa seem to suck
2013-10-10 19:34:30	dowaat	they've been fed 30 years of unions are evil
2013-10-10 19:34:35	MrElendig	dowaat: I ment, unions are often discriminated against
2013-10-10 19:34:48	dowaat	MrElendig: you cannot discriminate against a union lawfully
2013-10-10 19:34:51	mackerel	when i get to that point i plan on over doesing on some good drugs....
2013-10-10 19:35:02	MrElendig	dowaat: employees make up some bs reason to fire people if they are in a union etc
2013-10-10 19:35:10	MrElendig	or the same for not to hire them
2013-10-10 19:35:38	MrElendig	and sadly many of the unions themself are really worker unfriendly
2013-10-10 19:35:50	dowaat	we can employee abuse tactics to try and squelch the issue but if it kicks back as an anti-union practice under the NLRA I can be sued by the union, the harmed individual, and the federal government.
2013-10-10 19:35:58	MrElendig	like after the big storms, where workers from out of state was not allowed to work on the power grid in one state

2013-10-10 19:39:35	carharttjimmy	why is NC so anti union
2013-10-10 19:39:44	carharttjimmy	so I can orgainize a union in NC?
2013-10-10 19:39:47	dowaat	the same reason its one of the poorest states
2013-10-10 19:39:49	meskarune	dowaat: most states are at-will, which means they can hire and fire at will and employees can leave at will. It means they don't need a reason to fire someone. And then they can just make something up. If you are late even one day, they can say you are unreliable, or if you make a single mistake, they can say you have poor work quality, etc.
2013-10-10 19:40:08	dowaat	meskarune: even at-will falls short often times of holding up in court
2013-10-10 19:40:08	MrElendig	what meskarune said
2013-10-10 19:40:14	MrElendig	happens here too at times

2013-10-11 11:11:59	willybilly0101	wizzo, I did reported to my manager, because he (IT manager) forbid us to talk directly with IT department, only through helpdesk. So I told her (my manager), I have no ideea what happend from there and if someone else reported
2013-10-11 11:12:45	willybilly0101	wizzo, there is none. there is the attitude "people should not be chained in this corporation because they are under stress and making good money" from management. and strangely, they are making shitloads of money

2013-10-11 21:28:29	supergeek800	Got Archbang, which is pretty much a quick and painless way to an Arch install. Messed around with Manjaro in Vbox, not too crazy about its update frequency. Also tried Bridge in Vbox, didn't work. lol
2013-10-11 21:28:44	woddf2	supergeek800: I replaced Arch with Slackware and OpenBSD.

2013-10-11 21:32:53	mankypirate	debian stable is for when you've given up on life and just want to slowly fade away into nothingness
2013-10-11 21:33:09	supergeek800	CryptoNaut: Yep. Sid = Unstable.
2013-10-11 21:33:25	CryptoNaut	supergeek800: US~testing same difference
2013-10-11 21:33:27	CryptoNaut	still not a distro
2013-10-11 21:33:33	supergeek800	mankypirate: It also makes a good server distro for being stable.

2013-10-12 18:28:10	thewizord	to be fair though, #fedora is like a channel full of special needs children... Half the time they've got their hand down the back of their pants playing with shit.
2013-10-12 18:28:15	swilkens	how exactly are you using it that it supposed to bring forth the end-time?
2013-10-12 18:28:32	swilkens	*is
2013-10-12 18:28:34	thewizord	swilkens: any type of non-open drivers and software introduced to the system, any form of modifying the baseline system
2013-10-12 18:29:15	thewizord	swilkens: more or less if you make mention that you're using fedora + nvidia, they will flip the fuck out and infight for a good hour
2013-10-12 18:29:33	thewizord	its kinda funny, too, cos in the realm of distros fedora has potential to be one of the best... It just has a community that is structurally batshit
2013-10-12 18:29:33	swilkens	sounds like a sitcom oppertunity
2013-10-12 18:29:56	mankypirate	how does fedora have potential
2013-10-12 18:29:59	mankypirate	yum is shit
2013-10-12 18:30:13	mankypirate	no non-free stuff = useless
2013-10-12 18:30:19	mankypirate	and the fedora installer sucks dick
2013-10-12 18:30:25	thewizord	mankypirate: very stable base system, very good testing, corporate backing via redhat, cutting-edge updates, stability and structure of yum is quite nice
2013-10-12 18:30:37	thewizord	mankypirate: hating on yum just shows incompetency
2013-10-12 18:30:43	thewizord	yum is many things, but shit isn't one
2013-10-12 18:30:50	mankypirate	fast*
2013-10-12 18:30:54	thewizord	its slow, cumbersome, and redundant, but that comes with the perks of stability.
2013-10-12 18:31:45	thewizord	also, I havent' seen the installer since f17
2013-10-12 18:31:56	thewizord	f17 via fedup to f18, f18 via fedup to f19
2013-10-12 18:31:59	mankypirate	the partitioner sucks dick
2013-10-12 18:32:10	mankypirate	setting up raid is impossibru
2013-10-12 18:32:11	thewizord	my understanding, however, is that it is being changed again soon for f20
2013-10-12 18:32:14	mankypirate	or anything sane by hand
2013-10-12 18:32:26	thewizord	mankypirate: but we all know arch never sucks ever :P
2013-10-12 18:32:33	thewizord	you can hate on fedora but its misguided hate
2013-10-12 18:32:34	jelly1	ikr
2013-10-12 18:32:34	mankypirate	arch has a sane installer
2013-10-12 18:32:43	buhman	omfg kfc is so good
2013-10-12 18:32:56	mankypirate	the only thing that sucks in arch atm is the fucking intel gpu driver
2013-10-12 18:33:01	buhman	I also like grape drank
2013-10-12 18:33:04	thewizord	with fedora you have to accept the good with the bad, its a breeding ground for redhat testing... That means sometimes we take a really bad hit for stupid choices, but then we can bitch about it upstream until it goes away
2013-10-12 18:33:42	buhman	lolfedora
2013-10-12 18:33:51	thewizord	awe look another retard :3
2013-10-12 18:33:59	thewizord	the inbreeding is strong with this one
2013-10-12 18:34:23	buhman	incest is best
2013-10-12 18:34:26	swilkens	!opinions
2013-10-12 18:34:28	phrik	opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and they're always full of shit
2013-10-12 18:35:00	jelly1	:p
2013-10-12 18:35:08	thewizord	mankypirate: I've been around the block... Redhat was my first starting distro, then fedora, ubuntu, opensuse, arch, gentoo, back to arch, back to fedora, back to arch, and eventually back to fedora
2013-10-12 18:35:16	thewizord	any idea how I keep ending up back on fedora?? :\

2013-10-12 18:35:42	mankypirate	some people are masochists
2013-10-12 18:36:12	swilkens	redhast desktop being your first love, fedora being the free rhel upstream
2013-10-12 18:36:51	thewizord	swilkens: I don't really fall back out of loyalty, trust me... I lack loyalty to anything.
2013-10-12 18:37:16	buhman	lol switching distros
2013-10-12 18:37:30	mankypirate	but seriously everything but arch sucks
2013-10-12 18:37:36	buhman	mankypirate: including arch
2013-10-12 18:37:44	jelly1	I can't switch
2013-10-12 18:37:46	mankypirate	there's always some kind of bullshit happening with other dristros
2013-10-12 18:37:48	mankypirate	not with arch
2013-10-12 18:37:55	jelly1	I can't let allan down
2013-10-12 18:38:02	jelly1	arch needs moar drama

2013-10-12 18:38:35	thewizord	"theres never anything wrong with arch" has gotta be one of the funniest things I've ever heard
2013-10-12 18:38:43	buhman	I guess if you were delusional enough to think that there's actually such thing as a 'good distro', you might keep swapping distros indefinitely in your search for el-dorado
2013-10-12 18:38:51	swilkens	jelly1, you're letting him off gently... dropping a few packages at a time. you monster.
2013-10-12 18:38:57	jelly1	swilkens: wat
2013-10-12 18:39:01	mankypirate	thewizord: occasionally something breaks and you need to fix it so booting works, that's it
2013-10-12 18:39:12	thewizord	mankypirate: don't be a moronic fanboy
2013-10-12 18:39:18	thewizord	because moronic fanboys are the worst things arch has
2013-10-12 18:39:20	mankypirate	I'm not a fanboy
2013-10-12 18:39:25	mankypirate	I don't give a shit about arch as such
2013-10-12 18:39:27	thewizord	you guys are like ubuntu fanboys only with lower IQ's
2013-10-12 18:39:32	mankypirate	I use it because it works for me
2013-10-12 18:39:34	mankypirate	I could use anything
2013-10-12 18:39:43	thewizord	except you're bashing around like a retarded fanboy
2013-10-12 18:39:47	thewizord	so you're not a fanboy but you play one on TV, or what?
2013-10-12 18:39:56	swilkens	jelly1, I seem to recall list emails of you dropping quite a bulk of packages. maybe I'm mistaken.
2013-10-12 18:40:03	jelly1	swilkens: sure
2013-10-12 18:40:08	jelly1	swilkens: I drop legacly crap

2013-10-13 13:56:43	taotetek	the 12 million figure is the number of people it will "effect"

2013-10-13 13:56:48	taotetek	not the number of people they estimate it will kill.

2013-10-13 17:37:12	swilkens	thewizord, what bothers me is that government seems to be O.K. with this modus operandi of locking up government and sending workers home - all to push a political agenda

2013-10-13 17:54:00	thewizord	we've seen a 10.5% cash holdings drop since this started, and if the debt ceiling hits we expect to lose 26-39% of the liquid cash holdings... which will in turn leave us holding a bunch of bad derivatives and we'll likely collapse
2013-10-13 17:54:32	thewizord	we had just swapped derivatives back in August, and if this batch goes bad and we're caught with our pants down holding it... I'll be out looking for a job.
2013-10-13 17:54:51	swilkens	thewizord, is it expected that the GOP will reach an agreement before the debt default occurs?
2013-10-13 17:55:33	thewizord	eh
2013-10-13 17:55:41	thewizord	i think they truly feel they can push it over and the country be Okay
2013-10-13 17:56:07	thewizord	more recently we've been meeting with the big boys at Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and BoA because... well, basically, if it hits... there won't be some of us left
2013-10-13 17:56:31	thewizord	we're secretly hoping a big bank gets hit with the defaulted derivative swaps but... theres no telling who has what until they cash in
2013-10-13 17:56:43	thewizord	so
2013-10-13 17:56:47	swilkens	that's just insanity to me. the the USA defaults on debt there must be significant implications on global economy

2013-10-13 17:57:15	thewizord	swilkens, the USD may lose its place as international currency holder, which will collapse its value, our S&P index score will likely be reduced again
2013-10-13 17:57:22	thewizord	the stocks will collapse out of panic selling
2013-10-13 17:57:43	thewizord	the domino result of what investors can do when they panic is quite catastrophic
2013-10-13 17:57:56	thewizord	GOP morons are banking that investors won't panic... But they will.
2013-10-13 17:58:10	jelly1	ppl not panicing :o
2013-10-13 17:58:16	swilkens	quite a few cash withdrawels from the public I would think
2013-10-13 17:58:37	thewizord	an S&P index drop would cause people to try and sell off a lot of US based assets and see an upward swing on international trade indexes as people try to move to the Euro for security
2013-10-13 17:58:43	thewizord	it could basically collapse the USD entirely
2013-10-13 17:59:22	thewizord	the euro would inflate, the USD would collapse, oil would no longer trade on USD valuation, and the banks would collapse under the weight of derivatives all failing simultaneously
2013-10-13 17:59:32	thewizord	it has potential to make the great depression look like childs play...
2013-10-13 17:59:55	swilkens	the idea being that the prospect of national crisis will force the opposing party to agree to the GOP's desires?
2013-10-13 18:00:04	jelly1	yay just as the economy was working for a bit
2013-10-13 18:00:10	thewizord	swilkens, its hostage holding, yes
2013-10-13 18:00:16	swilkens	surely such a strategy must have a drastic impact of public approval
2013-10-13 18:00:18	thewizord	"gimme my way or I'll BLOW the economies brains out all over!"
2013-10-13 18:00:35	swilkens	how are they expecting to survive another round of elections
2013-10-13 18:00:44	jelly1	swilkens: money
2013-10-13 18:00:49	thewizord	because deeply entrenched idiots and a bad media system keep them alive
2013-10-13 18:00:57	jelly1	and money I guess
2013-10-13 18:00:58	thewizord	their approval rating is less than dog poop and nickelback (no joke)
2013-10-13 18:01:03	jelly1	lol
2013-10-13 18:01:10	thewizord	and people will still revote incumbents
2013-10-13 18:01:27	thewizord	the US news outlets are playing it like it was a bipartisan failure
2013-10-13 18:01:34	thewizord	they refuse to point fingers (for the first time ever)
2013-10-13 18:01:44	swilkens	I suppose a lot of it will be "hur hur lefties bad righties good"
2013-10-13 18:02:02	swilkens	it just boggles the mind
2013-10-13 18:02:13	thewizord	swilkens, now, i mean, you wont see all of these scenarios play out on the 17th
2013-10-13 18:02:20	GermainZ	swilkens: hurr durr!
2013-10-13 18:02:24	thewizord	it'll be just like initial shutdown, the first 6-or-so days, nothing major goes wrong
2013-10-13 18:02:40	thewizord	but then the sting starts to set in, protests slowly creep up, incomes go down, agencies start to pitfall
2013-10-13 18:03:06	thewizord	the debt ceiling will be nearly the same... At first, it'll allocate which key debts to pay and default on the less risky ones, but as time drags on it'll begin to collapse inward

2013-10-14 12:15:57	diegoviola	content should be freely distributable i think, and artists are probably better off accepting donations via flattr and similar, than trying to get pennies from middlemen corps, no?
2013-10-14 12:16:17	diegoviola	wouldn't that model work better
2013-10-14 12:16:27	dunz0r	I think the solution Bandcamp has is kinda nice.

2013-10-14 12:16:56	dunz0r	With the ability to listen through the whole album on the site unlimited times first.
2013-10-14 12:18:38	makediff	I think the artist should be in directly in control of their work and how it's distributed. The problem is that the labels and distributors see themselves as the owners (and in many cases are)
2013-10-14 12:18:57	makediff	And obviously they work purely based on business decisions without any concern to the artists or fans

Duchovny, not wanting to ruin the take, ad-libbed "...are you serious? I just told you that, a moment ago." Fortunately, the error fit Stiller's character and was left in the final film.

I've tried all the usual suspects (Firefox font settings, checking installed/missing fonts, font anti-aliasing). all settings are identical on my desktop where this doesn't happen.

2013-10-15 12:14:24	chee	that's a real question. i mean github uses sans-serif as its html { font-family: } but it declares nearly everything else specifically as 13px helvetica with an arial fallback
2013-10-15 12:14:27	rabbitear_sdf	so it pees on trees
2013-10-15 12:14:49	Achillion	Is it part of ttf-ms-fonts?
2013-10-15 12:14:55	chee	no i don't believe it is
2013-10-15 12:15:10	chee	but in that case you are probably falling back to arial (if you don't have helvetica)
2013-10-15 12:15:10	wizzo	have you got the freedom fonts package installed or w/e it's called

2013-10-15 13:13:20	Achillion	It was quite fun too. Built a list of fonts that exist on this laptop but not on the desktop using "comm", then wrote a script that does a pacman -Qi so I can check what the package is for and asked me if I want to remove :P
2013-10-15 13:14:55	Achillion	Well the reason it was such a mess was, I think, because at some point during early installation I was missing a font or two and saw on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/I_just_upgraded_and_my_fonts_are_all_ugly#Install_fonts_from_official_repositories the "hint" about installing *all* the fonts ... and probably did that :|

2013-10-15 17:06:15	dowaat	they're afraid to attack the outlets quite yet
2013-10-15 17:06:35	opt1mus	I use to watch RT too, as it gave out --maybe still does-- raw video without any political bias, that might be different now

2013-10-16 14:42:08	CryptoNaut	wizzo: compared to the current model, shelling out money to host your own shit, or some analogue approach, is way more sensible than being the pork in the market

2013-10-16 14:42:38	wizzo	cryptonaut: yeah, but it is an extreme amount of work and technical knowledge
2013-10-16 14:42:42	taotetek	when you "host your own stuff" you are hosting it on hostile hardware on hostile networks.
2013-10-16 14:42:56	 *	sammyf wondered whether the whole point of the shutdown wasn't to stop all the stuff that was "hindering" the USA. like welfare, agencies- weapon and environmental oversight and so on
2013-10-16 14:43:02	wizzo	yes you can provide a turnkey solution, but that still requires maintenance and trust
2013-10-16 14:43:15	CryptoNaut	wizzo: not unless there are people to work at usability solutions for it, there hardly are any, I mean the big bucks are in going with the flow =D
2013-10-16 14:43:26	taotetek	people who think "setting up my own server" is a solution to this don't comprehend the depth of the problem.

2013-10-16 14:46:11	taotetek	wizzo: you can't mitigate risk on this if the harware your OS is on had backdoored chips, and your OS is potentially back doored, and the network devices you're using are back doored.
2013-10-16 14:46:31	taotetek	and the backbone of the internet itself is back doored
2013-10-16 14:46:40	taotetek	and the PRNGs you rely on for encryption are compromised
2013-10-16 14:46:43	CryptoNaut	taotetek: I'm not suggesting I think there is an internet without the scurges we have online now, jsut that I hope it's not necessary for the near-total majority of people to be just products, and that a somewhat larger fraction can become... more self-aware

2013-10-16 14:48:04	CryptoNaut	taotetek: hmm, yeah. open hardware is pretty intriguing

2013-10-16 14:48:40	dagle	I guess US and NSA doesn't like piracy because it generates to much trafik for them. ;)
2013-10-16 14:48:42	CryptoNaut	that is, nobody else cares =\
2013-10-16 14:48:47	taotetek	if you want to help mitigate risk tell people they can't have privacy and security on the internet
2013-10-16 14:48:55	taotetek	instead of trying to give them something you can't.
2013-10-16 14:49:05	CryptoNaut	I'm unable to give anything, so I don

2013-10-16 15:01:07	CryptoNaut	nearly all, basically
2013-10-16 15:01:07	taotetek	cjross: if "stuff doesn't get run" you can't load a web page.

2013-10-16 15:02:12	Roukoswarf	the more you make yourself the 1%

2013-10-16 15:02:58	Roukoswarf	odd browser behaviour is tracked easier
2013-10-16 15:03:10	CryptoNaut	Roukoswarf: I know

2013-10-16 15:04:35	cjross	Roukoswarf, I block cross site requests.

2013-10-16 15:04:52	cjross	taotetek, I don't think that's the only way.  I just mention that as an example that most people don't think about.
2013-10-16 15:05:15	Roukoswarf	cjross: so... people cant link in external images on forums on your browser?
2013-10-16 15:05:20	Roukoswarf	sounds inconvenient

2013-10-16 22:35:03	woddf2	buhman: ?
2013-10-16 22:35:30	buhman	it's dropping all m3h packetszors
2013-10-16 22:35:45	woddf2	buhman: The round-robin should have worked.
2013-10-16 22:35:52	buhman	doesn't look like it
2013-10-16 22:36:15	woddf2	buhman: It should rDNS to _both_ tesseract.hackerhaven.net (down at the moment) *AND* turtil.net.
2013-10-16 22:36:52	buhman	right, and http://ix.io/8wm
2013-10-16 22:36:54	buhman	fix your shit
2013-10-16 22:37:36	woddf2	buhman: It appears to work correctly.  It tries HH first, and failing that, tries turtil.net.
2013-10-16 22:37:44	buhman	also why are you using motif/gtk1/whatever
2013-10-16 22:37:49	woddf2	buhman: I'm not.
2013-10-16 22:37:55	buhman	what's in the screnshot then
2013-10-16 22:38:04	woddf2	buhman: FVWM, Emacs, xterm
2013-10-16 22:38:21	herring	doesnt load for me either..
2013-10-16 22:38:28	buhman	also, your rDNS doesn't behave as you claim
2013-10-16 22:38:39	buhman	64.191.40.211 is PTR 64-191-40-211.static.hostnoc.net.
2013-10-16 22:38:45	woddf2	buhman: nslookup wlair.us.to if you don't believe me.
2013-10-16 22:39:08	woddf2	herring: Wait for it to give up on HH.
2013-10-16 22:39:12	buhman	woddf2: those are forward records
2013-10-16 22:39:28	woddf2	buhman: Well, tesseract _was_ at 64-dot.  Just ask meskarune.
2013-10-16 22:39:30	buhman	also 198.199.108.230 has no reverse record
2013-10-16 22:39:47	woddf2	buhman: 198-dot SHOULD be turtil.net.
2013-10-16 22:40:00	buhman	you should tell that to digitalocean
2013-10-16 22:40:39	buhman	fix your shit
2013-10-16 22:40:48	woddf2	buhman: Tell that to meskarune.
2013-10-16 22:40:53	buhman	dontcare
2013-10-16 22:41:48	buhman	also, wlair.us.to has no CNAMEs
2013-10-16 22:42:09	buhman	thus it *doesn't* forward-resolve to neither tesseract.hackerhaven.net nor turtil.net
2013-10-16 22:42:28	woddf2	buhman: They're A records.

2013-10-16 23:43:35	dowaat	john the boner is gonna vote for the senate resolution
2013-10-16 23:44:05	King_OnTheGo	What have they resolved?
2013-10-16 23:45:21	Roukoswarf	King_OnTheGo: that raising a limit on debt so they can hit it again solves all money problems
2013-10-16 23:45:44	dowaat	senate resolution or SR = a bill or law
2013-10-16 23:45:48	dowaat	HR = house resolutioin
2013-10-16 23:45:55	Roukoswarf	why dont they just give themselves infinite moneys

2013-10-16 23:49:14	dowaat	Roukoswarf: because of how the federal reserve works it is technically infinite because the debt ceiling can be raised as often as needed to produce more notes
2013-10-16 23:49:27	Roukoswarf	welcome to mexico
2013-10-16 23:49:37	velcroshooz	hold on to your sacagawea dollars, it'll be all we have left
2013-10-16 23:49:41	dowaat	in exchange it pushes borrowing rates and inflation up, but in concept because the dollar bill has no actual precious material value, it is all a fake valuation
2013-10-16 23:50:09	Roukoswarf	thats why bitcoin is great, and the same reason why it will fail

2013-10-16 23:50:15	Roukoswarf	its like trading in gold
2013-10-16 23:50:17	dowaat	Roukoswarf: at one time a 'federal reserve note' meant that the possessor of the note had X.XX amount of gold value in the reseve
2013-10-16 23:50:20	dowaat	today, the standard is gone
2013-10-16 23:50:33	Roukoswarf	trading in gold is horrible
2013-10-16 23:50:42	dowaat	meh
2013-10-16 23:50:44	Roukoswarf	same reason bitcoin moves by 30%
2013-10-16 23:50:46	King_OnTheGo	money is a pointless concept
2013-10-16 23:50:49	dowaat	gold is a time-tested currency
2013-10-16 23:50:52	Roukoswarf	dont trade with something valuable
2013-10-16 23:50:53	dowaat	so calling it terrible is silly
2013-10-16 23:50:56	King_OnTheGo	OMG SHINY METALZ
2013-10-16 23:51:11	King_OnTheGo	diamonds are soooo rare, we should use them
2013-10-16 23:51:15	velcroshooz	salt and seashells are time tested currency as well ;)
2013-10-16 23:51:16	dowaat	Roukoswarf: gold meant that as governments collapsed the notes still possessed value
2013-10-16 23:51:17	Roukoswarf	dowaat: trading in something rare, is bad for common trade
2013-10-16 23:51:25	dowaat	this worked for Mayan and Roman empires
2013-10-16 23:51:33	herring	i have a shitload of gold and silver us minted coins and a ton of silver certificates..
2013-10-16 23:51:37	velcroshooz	until insert spaniards
2013-10-16 23:51:37	King_OnTheGo	false historical parallels
2013-10-16 23:51:59	dowaat	velcroshooz: I'd imagine the currency didn't devalue entirely at that point either
2013-10-16 23:52:03	dowaat	the spanish love their gold
2013-10-16 23:52:05	King_OnTheGo	You must construct additional Spaniards.
2013-10-16 23:52:21	dowaat	the spanish are not pylons :P
2013-10-16 23:52:25	velcroshooz	dowaat: i think it went up actually didnt it? they say the european economy erupted after the spaniards returned
2013-10-16 23:52:26	King_OnTheGo	nou
2013-10-16 23:52:59	herring	my favorite coins are the steel pennies..
2013-10-16 23:53:06	dowaat	velcroshooz: because the mayan empires were lavish with gold
2013-10-16 23:53:15	dowaat	velcroshooz: gold standards are actually wise
2013-10-16 23:53:17	King_OnTheGo	they didn't use gold for money much
2013-10-16 23:53:24	velcroshooz	ive also read that even the smallest items were going for insane amounts of money since so many spaniards were flooded with gold then
2013-10-16 23:53:33	okra	interesting
2013-10-16 23:54:00	velcroshooz	milk, 100$
2013-10-16 23:54:01	dowaat	velcroshooz: the mayan empires used gold primarily as architecture fixtures and construction but also as a currency. Pilfering the cities proved a rich prospect for the Inquisitional forces
2013-10-16 23:54:31	dowaat	the romans probably had one of the best rare metal trade systems, it wasn't exclusively gold but also featured copper and silver
2013-10-16 23:54:57	King_OnTheGo	These generalizations are so massive, they almost equal your mother.
2013-10-16 23:55:26	herring	ive been thinking about smelting all my coins
2013-10-16 23:55:28	Roukoswarf	romans were dirt corrupt too
2013-10-16 23:55:34	dowaat	Roukoswarf: kinda like americans
2013-10-16 23:55:40	Roukoswarf	dowaat: almost
2013-10-16 23:55:43	dowaat	romans basically went fucking crazy from lead exposure and inbreeding
2013-10-16 23:55:45	King_OnTheGo	herring I want to smelt you.
2013-10-16 23:55:47	velcroshooz	rome may have been the first to use salt as a currency as well, thats cool
2013-10-16 23:55:49	herring	i bet
2013-10-16 23:55:50	Roukoswarf	il take rome over america
2013-10-16 23:55:55	herring	wheres the lube?
2013-10-16 23:56:10	dowaat	they piped with a lot of harmful materials for drinking water
2013-10-16 23:56:15	King_OnTheGo	dowaat learn to history
2013-10-16 23:56:18	dowaat	so its safe to say rome kinda went crazy a bit at its end
2013-10-16 23:56:35	Roukoswarf	well america started crazy
2013-10-16 23:56:38	Roukoswarf	i say thats worse
2013-10-16 23:56:40	King_OnTheGo	600+ centuries was quite the long end
2013-10-16 23:56:46	Roukoswarf	^
2013-10-16 23:57:06	velcroshooz	no more crazy than the first emperor of china drinking mercury because lore said it was an elixir of immortality, and consequently dying from it ;)
2013-10-16 23:57:27	Roukoswarf	velcroshooz: chinas emperors have always been batshitr
2013-10-16 23:57:35	King_OnTheGo	well, it's a decent preservative

2013-10-17 00:53:52	polyzen	probably true about most species back then

2013-10-17 00:54:46	opt1mus	I'm not familiar with that
2013-10-17 00:54:52	fogobogo	theres a correlation with the suspected colonisation of humans and the extinction of the megafauna (big animals)

The slot is ok (tested with the working stick). Additional addressing is enabled (the mobo previously worked with 2x4GB unti

That's not willing participation, it's imposed participation, a different issue."

2013-10-18 16:41:56	Achillion	nathan28-js: it uses a bit more than 1GB on my setup, but since I use kde pim, a lot of that compensates for not running stuff like calendar, todo list and email. KDE is awesome if you use all the toys
2013-10-18 16:41:59	nathan28-js	kubuntu is the one that called canonical out on its 'fundraising' right?
2013-10-18 16:42:03	dowaat	so anyone know the background story of digitalkiwi
2013-10-18 16:42:13	taotetek	nathan28-js: dunno, I don't pay any attention to linux distro drama
2013-10-18 16:42:15	dowaat	he was a practicing mormon and I ruthlessly picked on him until he got laid and quit the church....
2013-10-18 16:42:26	dowaat	then he became a pussy chaser 24/7, stopped developing, and all his projects died
2013-10-18 16:42:27	hs_maxim	hahahaa
2013-10-18 16:42:28	dowaat	it was awesome
2013-10-18 16:42:33	nathan28-js	dowaat: good job

2013-10-18 16:42:41	dowaat	yu[
2013-10-18 16:42:44	dowaat	yup
2013-10-18 16:42:51	dowaat	I picked on him every day for about 2 years for that
2013-10-18 16:42:52	dowaat	and he quit
2013-10-18 16:42:54	nathan28-js	hey guys i've got these gold tablets
2013-10-18 16:42:58	hs_maxim	something similar happened to me
2013-10-18 16:42:59	nathan28-js	then i lost them
2013-10-18 16:43:02	hs_maxim	cept i didn't get picked on
2013-10-18 16:43:04	mar77i	I do know the word mormon... at least, I think, but I think also there's a spare m there.
2013-10-18 16:43:07	hs_maxim	it just happened
2013-10-18 16:43:20	hs_maxim	i haven't made anything substantial in over a year

2013-10-18 16:43:37	taotetek	anyway my laptop with kde up and running is currently using 658 megs of ram.  so if you say you don't have enough ram to run kde maybe try a computer built before 1992.

2013-10-18 16:43:58	hs_maxim	but my 1995 computer had 8mb ram
2013-10-18 16:43:59	mar77i	dowaat: bruenig was banned right?
2013-10-18 16:44:01	dowaat	mar77i: no

2013-10-18 16:44:22	hs_maxim	you weren't at all likely to have over 640mb before 2001
2013-10-18 16:44:32	dowaat	mar77i: the ops around here think they had something to do with bruenigs departure, but that was 100% not the case. Bruenig had his at-the-time gf on the IRC's with him. When he eventually cheated she systematically blackmailed him to stay offline
2013-10-18 16:44:32	hs_maxim	and even then it would cost you
2013-10-18 16:44:36	dowaat	mar77i: and it worked.
2013-10-18 16:44:37	Achillion	2004 is when I got my first GB I think
2013-10-18 16:44:56	buhman	lul I had 384MB in 2004
2013-10-18 16:45:03	mar77i	ohlol
2013-10-18 16:45:11	buhman	and that was *COOL* because earlier I only had 128MB
2013-10-18 16:45:28	dowaat	carharttjimmy: why are you texting me pictures of a budlight truck you redneck?
2013-10-18 16:45:29	buhman	and I swapped a lot less
2013-10-18 16:45:30	Achillion	Well the "I think" part was because I build a P4 then, but I'm not sure if I build it with 512 or 1024
2013-10-18 16:45:40	demize	buhman: 1 seems a bit low
2013-10-18 16:45:44	mar77i	dowaat: so, in other words, bruenig fucked himself outtahere.
2013-10-18 16:45:49	jbsnake	i still remember ruining my main board trying to upgrade a 486 to pentium class
2013-10-18 16:46:01	dowaat	mar77i: in a way, she never did dump the blackmail but evidently it was enough to keep him off irc
2013-10-18 16:46:04	buhman	demize: just to make sure that during virtual memory exhaustion we always can snag all t3h ramz, no matter how small
2013-10-18 16:46:07	jbsnake	ahh… the days pre-slot 7
2013-10-18 16:46:10	dowaat	he shows up once in a while, says 2 or 3 things, and leaves.
2013-10-18 16:46:14	hs_maxim	there's why i have this rule

2013-10-18 17:51:04	nathan28-js	it's unclear to me why you would make it directly, you would sell the freebase from production as a byproduct so you had another revenue stream, just like cocaine freebase
2013-10-18 17:51:35	carharttjimmy	people went to krokodil because herion is very expensive
2013-10-18 17:51:39	nathan28-js	^
2013-10-18 17:51:46	carharttjimmy	so it wasn't by drug sellers who made the push

2013-10-18 17:52:01	nathan28-js	in south american 'basa' is cheap b/c it's a byproduct of coke production
2013-10-18 17:52:53	nathan28-js	then in the US chemists realized you could break cocaine down into freebase again and sell that, but it would be stronger and more addictive
2013-10-18 17:53:10	nathan28-js	then they realized you could mix it with a carrier substance and they made crack
2013-10-18 17:53:18	carharttjimmy	so chemistry is the root of all evil
2013-10-18 17:53:49	nathan28-js	then the US gov't started funding the contras through two guys who had a huge cocaine connection and they offloaded it on rick ross, "the one-man walmart of crack"

2013-10-18 23:40:48	dagle	That is what they all say up there.
2013-10-18 23:41:04	dowaat	drinking actually does the opposite of helping you sleep because the brain cannot enter REM as easily
2013-10-18 23:41:06	dowaat	just an FYI

2013-10-18 23:42:11	dowaat	it may sedate you but will not allow restful sleep, at all
2013-10-18 23:42:15	apn	dowaat, yes, it is. A glass of wine makes everyone sleepy.
2013-10-18 23:42:26	dowaat	feeling sleepy != entering REM sleep
2013-10-18 23:42:36	dagle	I know a guy that was trying so badly to sleep he ran into a wall trying to knock him self out for 1 hour of sleep.
2013-10-18 23:42:38	Cirrus_Minor	he is right LOTS of alcohol can actually stop one from sleeping
2013-10-18 23:42:38	dowaat	a 2mg tablet of Clonazepam will likely sedate you... you will not sleep well
2013-10-18 23:42:49	Cirrus_Minor	or prolonged use of alcohol
2013-10-18 23:42:59	dowaat	BZD's and alcohol share a similar pattern of inhibiting REM sleep
2013-10-18 23:43:02	dowaat	which is where RESTFUL sleep occurs
