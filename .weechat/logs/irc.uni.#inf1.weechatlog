2013-10-10 16:56:04	NeedHelp	how do you do the first question for the 2nd tutorial
2013-10-10 16:59:34	hamhut	can you think of a way that you could do it on paper?
2013-10-10 16:59:57	NeedHelp	nope
2013-10-10 17:00:11	NeedHelp	i don't know how to start it off
2013-10-10 17:01:07	hamhut	try and think what the question is asking you to do, and how you would solve the problem in a general way
2013-10-10 17:02:53	hamhut	look at the example and see if you can figure out what is being done
2013-10-10 17:04:54	NeedHelp	its just shifting everything backwards by 3 characters
2013-10-10 17:05:00	NeedHelp	3 spaces
2013-10-10 17:07:09	hamhut	okay, could we generalize more on what it is doing?

2013-10-10 17:15:39	NeedHelp	it takes the "n" you input
2013-10-10 17:15:54	NeedHelp	breaks the list apart from that n
2013-10-10 17:15:59	NeedHelp	and then adds it to the end of the list
2013-10-10 17:16:09	hamhut	yes, exactly
2013-10-10 17:17:10	hamhut	now how would you break up the list using the functions you have learnt?
2013-10-10 17:17:43	NeedHelp	drop?
2013-10-10 17:19:01	hamhut	try it out
2013-10-10 17:20:06	NeedHelp	ohhh
2013-10-10 17:20:06	NeedHelp	o see
2013-10-10 17:20:10	NeedHelp	i see
2013-10-10 17:20:12	NeedHelp	thanks a lot

2013-10-10 18:26:10	hamhut1066	KitB: thanks, I was trying not to give anything away
2013-10-10 18:30:56	NeedHelp	it was very helpful though
2013-10-10 18:31:01	NeedHelp	much better than just telling me how to do it
2013-10-10 18:31:37	hamhut1066	thanks, yeah, I didn't want to just give you the answer...
2013-10-10 18:31:55	hamhut1066	I have a query about mapping and folding and such
2013-10-10 18:32:23	hamhut1066	If I want to call map on a function with 2 vars ie.
2013-10-10 18:32:57	hamhut1066	map (rmChar (var I want to iterate through) "random var") (var I want to iterate through)
2013-10-10 18:33:07	hamhut1066	how would I do this?
2013-10-10 18:33:42	@KitB	give me an example of when you would want this?
2013-10-10 18:35:15	hamhut1066	I am doing next weeks exersize and I want to map the function rmChar :: Char -> String -> String with ['a'..'l'] and "football"
2013-10-10 18:35:32	hamhut1066	I could rewrite the rmChar function... but that is a hacky solution
2013-10-10 18:36:06	hamhut1066	eg: map (rmChar _ "football") ['a'..'l']
2013-10-10 18:37:12	hamhut1066	could I maybe to map ( `rmChar` "football") ['a'..'l'] ?
2013-10-10 18:37:14	@KitB	> let rmChar x = filter (/=x) in map (flip rmChar "football") ['a'..'l']
2013-10-10 18:37:15	lambdabot	  ["footbll","footall","football","football","football","ootball","football",...
2013-10-10 18:37:40	@KitB	Backticks work too
2013-10-10 18:38:43	hamhut1066	okay, but then how do you do that with a function taking in lots of variables?
2013-10-10 18:38:53	hamhut1066	or is that generally avoided?
2013-10-10 18:38:58	@KitB	Generally avoid
2013-10-10 18:39:00	@KitB	But you can
2013-10-10 18:39:04	@KitB	using a lambda function
2013-10-10 18:39:44	hamhut1066	okay, so it's a bit like tuples, where you can do stuff above 3, but you have to start doing your own thing
2013-10-10 18:39:46	@KitB	> let rmChar x = filter (/=x) in map (\c -> rmChar c "football") ['a'..'l']
2013-10-10 18:39:47	lambdabot	  ["footbll","footall","football","football","football","ootball","football",...
2013-10-10 18:40:20	hamhut1066	I'm gonna have to read about passing the output of one iteration of map into the next one
2013-10-10 18:40:34	hamhut1066	I assume this is possible?
2013-10-10 18:40:39	@KitB	Not really worth it
2013-10-10 18:40:49	@KitB	if you do:
2013-10-10 18:40:56	@KitB	map f (map g x)
2013-10-10 18:41:02	@KitB	then you can replace it with
2013-10-10 18:41:10	@KitB	map (f . g) x
2013-10-10 18:42:20	hamhut1066	kinda get it, because in the recursive version I did:
2013-10-10 18:43:01	hamhut1066	> let rmCharsRec (x:xs) str = rmCharsRec xs ([ a | a <- xs, a /= x])
2013-10-10 18:43:02	lambdabot	  not an expression: `let rmCharsRec (x:xs) str = rmCharsRec xs ([ a | a <- x...
2013-10-10 18:43:47	hamhut1066	dunno how I would write that in one line... but you can see how I am recursively reducing the string by filtering out each letter one at a time
2013-10-10 18:45:32	hamhut1066	you can recursively call map functions... didn't think of that
2013-10-10 18:45:49	@KitB	I suspect you don't want map here
2013-10-10 18:45:57	@KitB	rather you want to be recursively calling rmChar ;)
2013-10-10 18:47:25	hamhut1066	okay, but I think it's meant to be teaching me how to use fold
2013-10-10 18:47:42	@KitB	I haven't looked at the tutorial sheet yet :P
2013-10-10 18:49:03	hamhut1066	oops, accidentally turned it back into complete recursion

2013-10-15 21:26:26	Kcz	Hi Im working on the tutorial 3 and I'm stuck on 4d the foldr version,I think this should work but it keeps giving me an empty list
2013-10-15 21:26:43	Kcz	rmCharsFold :: String -> String -> String
2013-10-15 21:26:43	Kcz	rmCharsFold (x:xs) ys = foldr remove [] ys
2013-10-15 21:26:43	Kcz	 where
2013-10-15 21:26:43	Kcz	  remove x ys = rmChar x ys
2013-10-15 21:27:07	Kcz	any advice please ?
2013-10-15 21:47:43	-->	edran (~edran@188.74.74.197) has joined #inf1
2013-10-15 21:55:23	@KitB	Kcz: For starters your "remove" function is identical to rmChar
2013-10-15 21:55:41	@KitB	And the way you can immediately see this is actually a *very* interesting property of haskell
2013-10-15 21:56:11	@KitB	Or even the number of ways in which you can see this
2013-10-15 21:56:29	@KitB	But the quick explanation is that you can imagine it is like maths
2013-10-15 21:56:32	@KitB	and if you say
2013-10-15 21:57:01	@KitB	a(x, ys) = b(x, ys)
2013-10-15 21:57:08	@KitB	and if you can say that for all x and all ys
2013-10-15 21:57:12	@KitB	then you know that a = b
2013-10-15 21:57:57	@KitB	But that's not particularly important right now, just a tad interesting ^__^
2013-10-15 21:58:41	@KitB	What it means is if you replace "remove" with "rmChar", it will be exactly the same
2013-10-15 21:59:13	@KitB	The next important thing to note is that you don't need to be extracting the first element of your first input string (xs)
2013-10-15 21:59:33	@KitB	If we were using recursion you might want to do that
2013-10-15 21:59:48	@KitB	But lets just replace (x:xs) with xs
2013-10-15 22:00:01	@KitB	so your equation should start with:
2013-10-15 22:00:11	@KitB	rmCharsFold xs ys =
2013-10-15 22:00:38	@KitB	:t \xs ys -> foldr remove [] ys
2013-10-15 22:00:39	lambdabot	Not in scope: `remove'
2013-10-15 22:00:58	@KitB	I really need a way of loading scripts into lambdabot -_-
2013-10-15 22:01:05	@KitB	cronin101: Could you have a look into that?
2013-10-15 22:01:52	@KitB	> let rmChar x ys = filter (/=x) ys in rmChar 'c' "abcdefgc"
2013-10-15 22:01:54	lambdabot	  "abdefg"
2013-10-15 22:02:38	@KitB	:t let rmChar x ys = filter (/=x) ys in \xs ys -> foldr rmChar [] ys
2013-10-15 22:02:39	lambdabot	Eq a => t -> [a] -> [a]
2013-10-15 22:03:15	@KitB	So what lambdabot is telling us
2013-10-15 22:03:21	@KitB	(with this type signature)
2013-10-15 22:03:38	@KitB	is that the first argument of our function is of type 't'
2013-10-15 22:03:45	@KitB	Meaning it could be *anything*
2013-10-15 22:04:12	@KitB	The other arguments are restricted with "Eq a" and are in lists
2013-10-15 22:04:18	@KitB	But 't' couuld be any type at all
2013-10-15 22:04:25	@KitB	Now this *could* be correct
2013-10-15 22:04:39	@KitB	But normally if we have a completely generic type we should suspect something is wrong
2013-10-15 22:05:06	@KitB	In this case what it's telling us is that the first argument to our function is completely unused

2013-10-16 14:05:42	hamhut1066	that is a weird question, you need to convert from one type to another
2013-10-16 14:15:02	JameSmoove	how would I do it though? because I'm giving up and just about to leave now
2013-10-16 14:15:37	@KitB	JameSmoove: One moment
2013-10-16 14:15:44	@KitB	:t fromIntegral
2013-10-16 14:15:45	lambdabot	(Integral a, Num b) => a -> b
2013-10-16 14:15:52	@KitB	> fromIntegral 5
2013-10-16 14:15:53	lambdabot	  5
2013-10-16 14:16:03	@KitB	> fromIntegral 5/ 2
2013-10-16 14:16:04	lambdabot	  2.5
2013-10-16 14:16:06	@KitB	> fromIntegral 5 / 2
2013-10-16 14:16:07	lambdabot	  2.5
2013-10-16 14:16:23	@KitB	So fromIntegral will give you a float from an Int
2013-10-16 14:16:40	JameSmoove	right ok
2013-10-16 14:18:08	hamhut1066	in next weeks exersize, I'm normalizing the input... should I leave it as it is?

2013-10-16 14:20:35	hamhut1066	KitB: some of the url's have Caps in them, html is case insensitive, but the strings we are asked to check against are case sensitive... should I  change the strings or change my code?
2013-10-16 14:21:08	@KitB	I'm not sure, 
2013-10-16 14:21:19	@KitB	I'll accept either unless the document specifies otherwise ;)

2013-10-16 18:36:06	BobSmithIV	Entering the important part directly into GHCi returns the same message, ie using: map (\ pairxs -> zipWith (+) (fst pairxs) (snd pairxs) ) (zip [[0,0,0],[1,1,1][2,2,2]] [[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]])

2013-10-18 12:29:21	@KitB	I believe the issue will be that eventually `head xs` will error because xs will be []

2013-10-18 13:09:33	AndreBododea	Hey, me again. Same problemâ€¦â€¦https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7040147
2013-10-18 13:10:07	AndreBododea	is there a way to make the regular list comprehension work without zip? and if not, can you explain the given solution? I really don't understand how it works
2013-10-18 13:19:06	@KitB	One moment
2013-10-18 13:20:24	@KitB	And I would say no
2013-10-18 13:20:36	@KitB	Even if there is a way to do it without effectively zipping
2013-10-18 13:20:49	@KitB	(either by using zip or by implementing something that acts like zip)
2013-10-18 13:20:58	@KitB	It wouldn't be a good solution
2013-10-18 13:25:42	AndreBododea	ok but how does the zip work here? i can see that you end up comparing the x and y but what are you zipping together?
2013-10-18 13:25:56	AndreBododea	i mean checking to see if the x and y are equal*
2013-10-18 13:26:28	@KitB	you are zipping the input list with its tail
2013-10-18 13:27:13	@KitB	> let (x:xs) = [1..20] in zip (x:xs) xs
2013-10-18 13:27:14	lambdabot	  [(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,6),(6,7),(7,8),(8,9),(9,10),(10,11),(11,12),(12...
2013-10-18 13:28:38	@KitB	> zip xs (tail xs) where xs = [1..20]
2013-10-18 13:28:39	lambdabot	  <hint>:1:18: parse error on input `where'
2013-10-18 13:28:44	@KitB	> zip xs (tail xs); where xs = [1..20]
2013-10-18 13:28:45	lambdabot	  <hint>:1:17: parse error on input `;'
2013-10-18 13:29:57	@KitB	> zip xs (tail xs) where {xs = [1..20]}
2013-10-18 13:29:58	lambdabot	  <hint>:1:18: parse error on input `where'
2013-10-18 13:30:40	 *	KitB gives up on a one-line where
2013-10-18 13:35:16	AndreBododea	ok i think i understand how the zip works. but what would the zip xs (tail xs) where xs = [1..20] return? is it something like (1,20),(2,20),(3,20),(4,20)â€¦.etc?
2013-10-18 13:36:02	@KitB	no it'd be the same thing as the one with the let
2013-10-18 13:36:09	@KitB	Which is what I'm trying to demonstrate
2013-10-18 13:36:42	@KitB	Your list comprehension would draw (x, y) from [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)...]
2013-10-18 13:37:02	AndreBododea	OH my bad, forgot what "tail" does
2013-10-18 13:37:10	AndreBododea	no i got it now, it makes sense

2013-10-22 20:35:03	doro	Hey, can you give any advise about takeUntil function (week 6 tutorial exercise 4)
2013-10-22 20:40:25	hamhut	yep, what do you want to know?
2013-10-22 20:40:30	hamhut	where are you stuck
2013-10-22 20:43:45	doro	on question 4/a
2013-10-22 20:45:47	doro	my idea is, to take the head of the second list and add it to the front of the first list. If that string is a prefix of the second string then return the head, if not append the second character of the second sting to the head and go on with the checking
2013-10-22 20:46:30	doro	eventually the substring of the second string plus the first string will be a prefix of the second string in which case i have to return the substring
2013-10-22 20:47:35	hamhut	okay, I think I see what you are trying to do.
2013-10-22 20:47:54	hamhut	so, if we start with "c" "abce" how would it work?
2013-10-22 20:50:02	doro	it takes 'a' and appends it to "c" so we get "ac". I previoulsy defined a prefix function which works.
2013-10-22 20:50:34	doro	then I use this function with "ac" and "abce" which will return False.
2013-10-22 20:51:03	doro	Then we append 'b' to 'a' so we get "ab" and we append this to "c" so we get "abc"
2013-10-22 20:51:32	doro	we call prefix "abc" "abce" which is True so we can return "ab" a a result
2013-10-22 20:52:17	hamhut	okay, yeah, that makes sense. but in the question you have to return "ab" at the end and not "abc"
2013-10-22 20:52:37	doro	i returned "ab"
2013-10-22 20:52:50	hamhut	is it working? what is your code?
2013-10-22 20:53:08	doro	i don't have a code because i don't know how to do this in haskell
2013-10-22 20:53:26	doro	how to store the substring
2013-10-22 20:54:30	doro	is it possible to do something like this?

2013-10-22 20:54:56	hamhut	yes, this is what I think you might struggle with.
2013-10-22 20:55:14	hamhut	and it is possible, you have all the pieces you need.
2013-10-22 20:55:39	hamhut	try first doing the first bit, including the test string, and see if that works
2013-10-22 20:56:43	doro	takeUntil "b" "abce"?
2013-10-22 20:59:35	hamhut	yeah, just see if you can get "ab" as an output.
2013-10-22 20:59:58	hamhut	try and build the function one part at a time
2013-10-22 21:00:08	doro	okey
2013-10-22 21:00:55	StrawHatter	anyone know how long the CL tutorial work takes?
2013-10-22 21:02:07	Sunstrike	Hour-ish
2013-10-22 21:02:13	Sunstrike	Probably less.
2013-10-22 21:02:24	Sunstrike	'least half hour.
2013-10-22 21:02:44	StrawHatter	Blegh
2013-10-22 21:04:10	StrawHatter	ugh, 9 pages </3
2013-10-22 21:05:58	StrawHatter	oh thank gosh like 3 of it is work
2013-10-22 21:06:29	hamhut	doro: the way you are doing it is pretty difficult, I would try and think of another way of doing it... maybe the 'drop' function
2013-10-22 21:06:53	doro	okey let me think of something then
2013-10-22 21:07:00	hamhut	StrawHatter: yeah, cl kinda sucks, it's not too bad though
2013-10-22 21:08:50	StrawHatter	one of these days i'll get over the laziness that uni has gifted upon me
2013-10-22 21:08:54	StrawHatter	just not today
2013-10-22 21:09:13	StrawHatter	... if tutorial work isn't handed in
2013-10-22 21:09:13	StrawHatter	can't i just
2013-10-22 21:09:21	StrawHatter	write a bunch of letters?
2013-10-22 21:10:24	doro	it won't help you to prepare for the exam
2013-10-22 21:14:04	doro	Hamhut i can't think of any way to implement drop
2013-10-22 21:16:17	hamhut	are you using your 'prefix function to test if they are a prefix?
2013-10-22 21:17:25	hamhut	then you need to check if "abcd" is prefixed by "b", if it isn't then you need to check if "bcd" is prefixed by "b", if it is then you need to return all the letters that have passed.
2013-10-22 21:17:55	doro	i see what i can do, thank you
2013-10-22 21:19:39	StrawHatter	doro, you can even test it out here on IRC
2013-10-22 21:20:00	StrawHatter	let product xs = product [x | x <- xs]
2013-10-22 21:20:03	StrawHatter	er
2013-10-22 21:20:05	StrawHatter	smooth
2013-10-22 21:20:11	StrawHatter	i feel like a bit of an idiot
2013-10-22 21:20:16	StrawHatter	brb sobbing 
2013-10-22 21:20:50	doro	:D:D
2013-10-22 21:21:42	StrawHatter	right
2013-10-22 21:21:53	StrawHatter	time to do this painstackingly long work
2013-10-22 21:22:05	StrawHatter	> let product xs = product [x | x <- xs]
2013-10-22 21:22:06	lambdabot	  not an expression: `let product xs = product [x | x <- xs]'
2013-10-22 21:22:11	StrawHatter	lambdabot
2013-10-22 21:22:16	StrawHatter	i'll kick you in the face
2013-10-22 21:22:21	StrawHatter	that is an expresion
2013-10-22 21:25:38	hamhut	doro: good! have you got it?
2013-10-22 21:29:26	doro	nope
2013-10-22 21:32:05	hamhut	okay, but you can see how it works?
2013-10-22 21:32:48	doro	actually no
2013-10-22 21:32:54	doro	or wait
2013-10-22 21:33:00	doro	i misunderstood something
2013-10-22 21:34:13	hamhut	so you can recursively do this, maybe try just going through the list that you are checking and drop one character at a time
2013-10-22 21:34:20	hamhut	then add the conditional
2013-10-22 21:35:21	doro	to be honest i don't really understand how drop could work in this problem
2013-10-22 21:35:45	doro	i mean i understandyour idea just don't know how to interpret it into code
2013-10-22 21:38:06	hamhut	think about what you need to pass back into the function "abcd" what needs to be passed in on the first iteration?
2013-10-22 21:38:52	hamhut	and the second iteration... to the nth iteration
2013-10-22 21:40:06	doro	i think i am too tired to think this through now, i1ll get back to it tmw, thanks for your help
2013-10-22 21:41:34	hamhut	no problem, I'll be here still... more than happy to help

2013-10-25 12:28:49	@ChrisB	davidS: Think about it first in terms of the logic. If two logical statements are equivalent then if one is true then the other is true and vice versa, for any valuation of the variables... does that help?
2013-10-25 12:32:12	@ChrisB	Then think about how you would write that in terms of the functions you have already defined.

2013-10-27 13:14:42	angusp	aLeX: Q5 doesn't look too nice. I haven't got that far yet (cba reading algabraic data types, wait for lecure) but it's probably an idea to think about breaking stuff up into lists of props using parentheses to indicate precedence
2013-10-27 13:16:31	angusp	as in ((P & Q) | (R | Q)) --> [(P&Q),(R|Q)] where you know that list is delimited by an or

2013-10-27 19:35:34	@KitB	nano's pretty good
2013-10-27 19:35:58	@KitB	It does as a replacement when I'm editing on someone else's system and they don't have vim installed
2013-10-27 19:36:01	angusp	I like nano for simple stuff like git commit messages and markdown, but vim/emacs for programming
2013-10-27 19:36:21	Sunstrike	Vim is awesome for Markdown. It has syntax highlighting if you have the plugin.
2013-10-27 19:36:32	@KitB	Indeed
2013-10-27 19:36:33	Sunstrike	All my lecture notes are in Markdown with Vim x3
2013-10-27 19:36:38	@KitB	It's not bad for it even without any plugins
2013-10-27 19:37:18	angusp	MD is just pure awesome... and byt nature gets by ok without syntax hilighting... having said that, i think nano on my system does hilight md...?
2013-10-27 19:37:32	@KitB	I think I have some config for tagbar that allows jumping sections in MD
2013-10-27 19:37:47	angusp	Sunstrike: wait, what? You make notes in CL? :D
2013-10-27 19:37:53	Sunstrike	â€¦Except CL
2013-10-27 19:38:03	Sunstrike	I make 'em in FP and Earth Dynamics?
2013-10-27 19:38:18	angusp	Earth Dynamics? That sounds cool...
2013-10-27 19:38:32	Sunstrike	It's basically a fancy name for Geology 101
2013-10-27 19:38:41	angusp	drawing a fsm in md would be a wee bit difficult
2013-10-27 19:38:49	Sunstrike	Haha :P
2013-10-27 19:38:54	Sunstrike	I'm using a book to study CL
2013-10-27 19:39:18	@KitB	Seriously, is he *that* bad?
2013-10-27 19:39:21	angusp	I guess it's fancy in the same way Industrial Management is a fancy name for ( business studies ) studies
2013-10-27 19:39:44	Sunstrike	He's that bad. To me atleast.
2013-10-27 19:39:54	Sunstrike	The books aren't too shoddy though so hey
2013-10-27 19:40:11	@KitB	Well I don't recall it being a particularly hard course
2013-10-27 19:40:17	angusp	KitB: Just paced wrong: You can't catch the notation in time then it doesn't matter how clever you are, you have no idea what you're looking at
2013-10-27 19:48:07	Sunstrike	Paced wrong and imparsably mumbley
2013-10-27 19:50:09	angusp	KitB: Not too sure about the wording in some of the haskell stuff: Does either p is a taut. or !p is satisfiable mean XOR or OR?
2013-10-27 19:50:56	@KitB	if I recall correctly, "either - or -" is generally taken as OR in formal logic circles
2013-10-27 19:51:16	@KitB	But contextually
2013-10-27 19:51:22	@KitB	It seems more like a XOR
2013-10-27 19:52:10	angusp	Yeah, it's for one of the quickcheck props, and that's what I was thinking. XOR is (A || B) && !(A && B) logically, I think?
2013-10-27 19:52:28	@KitB	Correct, at a glance
2013-10-27 20:02:07	angusp	Yeah, xor seemed to work

2013-10-27 20:52:24	StrawHatter	what if i have trouble taking in information by reading?

2013-10-27 20:52:54	@KitB	I find it's more useful to go through exercises

2013-10-27 21:04:01	angusp	Java is very capable but not very.. efficient
2013-10-27 21:04:03	StrawHatter	It shouldn't be /as/ bad

2013-10-27 21:07:18	@KitB	But it's not the language for every situation
2013-10-27 21:08:02	angusp	Yeah, and it would be hell to do even some of the haskell stuff in C... List blitting & technically infinite subroutines?! Yuck.
2013-10-27 21:08:35	@KitB	C is very useful for the situations it's useful in
2013-10-27 21:08:39	StrawHatter	anugsp: How long did the "reading" take you?
2013-10-27 21:09:01	angusp	I just like it for talking to IO and doing basic manipulation, but coming to think of it some algorithms are just torture to impliment
2013-10-27 21:09:12	angusp	StrawHatter: Not officially started yet
2013-10-27 21:09:19	StrawHatter	I personally wish they would teach C in schools instead of Visual Basic since it tells you like memory and processor management
2013-10-27 21:09:22	@KitB	On the other hand it can be *really* good for doing data structures efficiently
2013-10-27 21:10:10	@KitB	I agree with not teaching VB
2013-10-27 21:10:16	angusp	any BASIC teaches bad habits imho
2013-10-27 21:10:18	@KitB	But C would not be a good idea
2013-10-27 21:10:25	angusp	C is 'the deep end'
2013-10-27 21:10:39	@KitB	and the deep end is pedagogically terrible
2013-10-27 21:11:07	StrawHatter	Is it wrong that I actually liked VB?... pls don't hurt/hate me now 
2013-10-27 21:11:16	@KitB	No
2013-10-27 21:11:20	@KitB	Not a problem
2013-10-27 21:11:23	angusp	At least C is better than assember :D
2013-10-27 21:11:27	@KitB	Modern BASICs are pretty good
2013-10-27 21:11:31	@KitB	I hear
2013-10-27 21:11:35	@KitB	Never used one myself
2013-10-27 21:12:09	angusp	I have done CASIO basic and it's fine, just weird with respect to gotos and how it 'thinks' about functions & data
2013-10-27 21:12:36	angusp	no such thing as a proper function, just part of the code you jump to
2013-10-27 21:12:40	@KitB	now gotos
2013-10-27 21:13:14	@KitB	they are definitely a bad thing
2013-10-27 21:13:22	@KitB	except occasionally in embedded programming
2013-10-27 21:13:59	angusp	They work, just they are a bad way of thinking about how instructions and low level stuff actually happens
2013-10-27 21:16:37	@KitB	StrawHatter: Seriously don't worry about semester one
2013-10-27 21:16:43	@KitB	or any of first year
2013-10-27 21:17:07	@KitB	Just passit
2013-10-27 21:17:14	@KitB	s/passit/pass it/
2013-10-27 21:17:22	StrawHatter	@KitB: what if i'm worried about passing it
2013-10-27 21:17:22	lambdabot	Unknown command, try @list
2013-10-27 21:17:39	@KitB	You shouldn't be
2013-10-27 21:18:25	StrawHatter	but, i am
2013-10-27 21:20:04	@KitB	Well stop it ;)
2013-10-27 21:20:39	@KitB	and ask questions
2013-10-27 21:20:42	@KitB	all the time
2013-10-27 21:20:56	StrawHatter	that requires confidence though
2013-10-27 21:21:23	angusp	StrawHatter: Better to just go at it, get stuck and ask. No-one here will have a pop at you :)
2013-10-27 21:21:31	@KitB	StrawHatter: Ask questions in here
2013-10-27 21:23:39	StrawHatter	Nah, I'll just go for it, if i can't do it, i can't do it. 
2013-10-27 21:24:19	angusp	Most of it is just working out what you're being asked to do; Once you've got that covered, you'll be fine
2013-10-27 21:25:17	@KitB	This channel is here for you to ask us questions
2013-10-27 21:33:34	@KitB	You can ask in #compsoc too
2013-10-27 21:36:31	angusp	...although #compsoc would be better names #linux-rants
2013-10-27 21:36:39	angusp	*named
2013-10-27 21:38:07	@KitB	I haven't been following the goings on in there recently
2013-10-27 21:38:25	 *	KitB needs to test something
2013-10-27 21:38:28	@KitB	slap angusp
2013-10-27 21:38:32	@KitB	@slap angusp
2013-10-27 21:38:32	 *	lambdabot will count to five...
2013-10-27 21:38:40	@KitB	@slap angusp
2013-10-27 21:38:40	 *	lambdabot pulls angusp through the Evil Mangler
2013-10-27 21:38:51	@KitB	@slap angusp
2013-10-27 21:38:51	 *	lambdabot places her fist firmly on angusp's jaw
2013-10-27 21:38:54	angusp	You're an op... so /kick --in-the-balls angusp should work
2013-10-27 21:39:07	@KitB	It's more fun to have lambdabot do stuff
2013-10-27 21:39:27	angusp	OK, who wrote lambdabot and where can I fork their code from?
2013-10-27 21:39:43	angusp	@murder angusp
2013-10-27 21:39:43	lambdabot	Unknown command, try @list
2013-10-27 21:39:47	angusp	@list
2013-10-27 21:39:47	lambdabot	What module?  Try @listmodules for some ideas.
2013-10-27 21:40:02	angusp	That's a dumb suggestion
2013-10-27 21:40:19	@KitB	angusp: It's written in Haskell. Are yousure?
2013-10-27 21:40:26	@KitB	I think my space bar is slightly broken
2013-10-27 21:40:59	angusp	I actually like Haskell, even as a 'see' person. My spacebar spassesout too sometimes
2013-10-27 21:41:42	@KitB	ehehehe
2013-10-27 21:41:58	@KitB	I love Haskell too
2013-10-27 21:42:20	angusp	It's quite elegant, although using "/=" instead of "!=" is innexcusable!
2013-10-27 21:42:30	 *	angusp cannot spell today
2013-10-27 21:42:39	@KitB	But it requires a lot more thought than writing python
2013-10-27 21:43:43	angusp	Yeah, but tutorial5 is actually a really elegant piece of code; The custom types and stuff is really handy
2013-10-27 21:45:13	@KitB	Is five the propositional logic one?
2013-10-27 21:45:57	angusp	Yeah. I am impressed by the whole ADT millarchy is pretty cool
2013-10-27 21:46:11	angusp	wait, that's not even english :/
2013-10-27 21:46:59	StrawHatter	how on earth do you guys get haskell? 
2013-10-27 21:47:07	StrawHatter	i feel like i'm the only one who still hasn't caught onto it
2013-10-27 21:48:06	angusp	It's completely mindfucking until you can think about how to hit an operation with recursion; then it flows quite easily
2013-10-27 21:49:56	StrawHatter	so i'll probably not get there in time for the exam, great
2013-10-27 21:51:01	angusp	Kust go over the tutorial content, and just give it your best shot, then maybe ask someone to have a look at it irl, like me or hamhut
2013-10-27 21:54:07	StrawHatter	what if i've tried that like 3 times
2013-10-27 21:54:11	StrawHatter	and it just doens't sink in
2013-10-27 21:56:54	angusp	Just write stuff in haskell: you need to put in about 5 hours before you 'get' it
2013-10-27 22:01:34	StrawHatter	 ooorrrr i can already plan ahead and come up with a plan for what happens after failing uni
2013-10-27 22:06:05	@KitB	StrawHatter: Have you read Learn You a Haskell?
2013-10-27 22:06:12	@KitB	Are you attending your tutorials?
2013-10-27 22:06:16	@KitB	and the extra tutorials?
2013-10-27 22:07:08	StrawHatter	Yes, no aaaaaand no
2013-10-27 22:09:02	StrawHatter	Well.. When I say read I mean I got to chapter 3
2013-10-27 22:09:31	@KitB	You should at least be attending your tutorials
2013-10-27 22:09:40	@KitB	Have you not been receiving emails about not attending?
2013-10-27 22:10:28	StrawHatter	I'm fairly certain after the third one, they've given up on it
2013-10-27 22:11:30	@KitB	You should really be attending
2013-10-27 22:11:42	@KitB	If you don't want to attend the tutorials you have
2013-10-27 22:11:45	@KitB	If they're too early
2013-10-27 22:11:51	@KitB	or the tutor is bad or intimidating or whatever
2013-10-27 22:12:00	@KitB	Then switch tutorial groups
2013-10-27 22:12:02	@KitB	try another tutor
2013-10-27 22:12:09	angusp	StrawHatter: You could ask to change group to me, hamhut or KitB's if that'd be easier for you?
2013-10-27 22:12:10	@KitB	You're welcome to attend either of my tutorials
2013-10-27 22:12:12	StrawHatter	Is being scarred an option?
2013-10-27 22:12:19	@KitB	It very much is
2013-10-27 22:12:24	StrawHatter	Oh great
2013-10-27 22:12:34	@KitB	As long as you then switch to another group.
2013-10-27 22:12:38	StrawHatter	I
2013-10-27 22:12:43	StrawHatter	Meant scarred of the subject itself
2013-10-27 22:13:05	@KitB	Quick check: do you mean "scared"?
2013-10-27 22:13:24	StrawHatter	Yes
2013-10-27 22:13:36	@KitB	Splendid
2013-10-27 22:13:43	@KitB	It can be a very scary course
2013-10-27 22:13:47	@KitB	Haskell is weird
2013-10-27 22:13:58	angusp	Correction: Fucking weird
2013-10-27 22:14:06	@KitB	angusp++
2013-10-27 22:14:09	@KitB	I love it
2013-10-27 22:14:13	@KitB	but it's weird as hell
2013-10-27 22:14:18	angusp	angusp append
2013-10-27 22:14:30	angusp	see, already thinking in it :D
2013-10-27 22:14:30	StrawHatter	angusppend*
2013-10-27 22:14:47	angusp	StrawHatter: append
2013-10-27 22:14:52	@KitB	Can't even express angusp++ succinctly
2013-10-27 22:14:55	@KitB	in Haskell
2013-10-27 22:15:07	@KitB	There's the State a monad
2013-10-27 22:15:13	@KitB	(and yes I mean "State a")
2013-10-27 22:15:16	@KitB	(it's parametric)
2013-10-27 22:15:19	angusp	angusp ++ "w00t". There. IFTFY
2013-10-27 22:15:26	@KitB	It's not the same
2013-10-27 22:15:38	angusp	...if i'm a char, i think?
2013-10-27 22:15:44	@KitB	Nope
2013-10-27 22:15:46	@KitB	String
2013-10-27 22:15:47	angusp	no, shite. list
2013-10-27 22:15:50	@KitB	:t (++)
2013-10-27 22:15:51	lambdabot	[a] -> [a] -> [a]
2013-10-27 22:17:01	angusp	Just asking about tut5, why are (Var "P") and (Var "Q") not equivalent props?
2013-10-27 22:17:29	@KitB	They have different names?
2013-10-27 22:17:31	angusp	but say (R | !R) and (Q | !Q) are?
2013-10-27 22:18:03	@KitB	R | ~R and Q | ~Q are both tautologies
2013-10-27 22:18:34	@KitB	As such they give the same output for the same input (truth assignment)
2013-10-27 22:19:00	@KitB	Because they will always be true
2013-10-27 22:19:03	angusp	I guess. So just check for tautologies, then compare using envs from one of the props?
2013-10-27 22:19:19	@KitB	Having not read the tutorial questions
2013-10-27 22:19:22	@KitB	I will say no
2013-10-27 22:19:40	@KitB	You should probably produce a function that will work on a tautology anyway
2013-10-27 22:19:44	@KitB	But I could well be wrong
2013-10-27 22:20:32	angusp	erm, just thinking of recursing through evaluating the two props with a given set of envs, then folding with &&
2013-10-27 22:20:47	angusp	...which requires the same variable names
2013-10-27 22:21:06	@KitB	Give it a go
2013-10-27 22:21:11	@KitB	Tell me if it goes wrong
2013-10-27 22:22:07	angusp	Will do... Probably github gist it in a sec
2013-10-27 22:22:35	@KitB	StrawHatter: Do you know any othr programming languages btw?
2013-10-27 22:23:06	@KitB	brb
2013-10-27 22:23:16	StrawHatter	@KitB: I've done a fair amount of C# and quite a bit of VB.NET in Highschool 
2013-10-27 22:23:16	lambdabot	Unknown command, try @list
2013-10-27 22:25:50	angusp	C# is a good language
2013-10-27 22:25:55	@KitB	It is
2013-10-27 22:25:58	@KitB	and similar to Java
2013-10-27 22:26:03	@KitB	in many ways
2013-10-27 22:26:12	@KitB	and as a result directly useful to you
2013-10-27 22:26:22	@KitB	for the Java course next semester
2013-10-27 22:26:27	angusp	..unlike c!
2013-10-27 22:26:46	angusp	usefulness in INF1: 0. Maybe even negative.
2013-10-27 22:27:55	@KitB	It'll come in handy if you take:
2013-10-27 22:27:57	@KitB	Inf2C
2013-10-27 22:28:02	@KitB	wait
2013-10-27 22:28:06	@KitB	Inf2C:CS
2013-10-27 22:28:14	@KitB	They split 2C into two courses
2013-10-27 22:28:23	@KitB	Operating Systems
2013-10-27 22:28:32	@KitB	Computer Graphics
2013-10-27 22:28:38	@KitB	Computer Animation and Visualization
2013-10-27 22:28:47	@KitB	PPLS
2013-10-27 22:28:48	angusp	Yeah... C is the only really viable language to write an OS in... other than assembler
2013-10-27 22:28:59	@KitB	(Parallel Programming Languages and Systems)
2013-10-27 22:29:18	@KitB	I was about to say that I believe Windows is written in C++
2013-10-27 22:29:29	@KitB	but I think that's a bad example
2013-10-27 22:30:34	@KitB	You'll have to excuse me if I respond a bit infrequently for the next few minutes
2013-10-27 22:30:40	@KitB	I need to clean my parrot
2013-10-27 22:30:49	@KitB	and his cage
2013-10-27 22:31:16	angusp	KitB: Too much awesome
2013-10-27 22:31:29	angusp	Windows isn't a POSIX os anyways, so fuck it.
2013-10-27 22:32:27	StrawHatter	>For the Java course next semester
2013-10-27 22:32:31	angusp	Actuall, just googled that...
2013-10-27 22:32:33	StrawHatter	Don't wanna sound rude or anything but
2013-10-27 22:32:44	StrawHatter	I'd actually have to pass first semester for it to be useful at all
2013-10-27 22:33:18	@KitB	Actually not true
2013-10-27 22:33:23	@KitB	You can't fail a single semester
2013-10-27 22:33:43	@KitB	Unless you decide to leave you're gonna be doing next semester
2013-10-27 22:33:54	StrawHatter	I
2013-10-27 22:34:07	StrawHatter	Meant that if I fail a few modules, they won't let me do second year
2013-10-27 22:34:16	StrawHatter	Or at least that's how I've been told it works
2013-10-27 22:34:16	angusp	StrawHatter: Might let you retake
2013-10-27 22:34:24	@KitB	s/Might/Will
2013-10-27 22:34:39	@KitB	For the first two years you can resitanything
2013-10-27 22:34:42	@KitB	Damn space bar
2013-10-27 22:35:00	StrawHatter	I meant if I failed the resit sorry
2013-10-27 22:35:18	angusp	s/damn/sirrius-cybernetics-happy-space-maker
2013-10-27 22:36:16	angusp	StrawHatter: Seriously man, this is all harder to you in your head than it actually is, you can pass all this stuff no problems
2013-10-27 22:36:44	@KitB	also that.
2013-10-27 22:36:52	@KitB	and even if you fail resits
2013-10-27 22:36:56	@KitB	You can resit again
2013-10-27 22:37:12	StrawHatter	angusp: I really know I can't pass this stuff
2013-10-27 22:37:19	@KitB	I ended first year with only 100 credits btw
2013-10-27 22:37:21	angusp	look at me, sitting here on IRC and not doing the reading, will probably blag the test and maybe get 5/10 or less, and then have no idea what toby is going on about in ILA
2013-10-27 22:37:38	@KitB	Don't worry too much about the reading
2013-10-27 22:37:59	StrawHatter	It's not so much the reading that's bothering me, it's the course itself
2013-10-27 22:38:45	angusp	StrawHatter: Honestly just give it your best go, you may as well as you're here already.
2013-10-27 22:38:47	StrawHatter	I think I'm seriously the first person to complain about UniofEdinburgh this much
2013-10-27 22:39:16	@KitB	nah
2013-10-27 22:39:29	@KitB	plenty of people have
2013-10-27 22:39:36	@KitB	The uni is really lenient about things btw
2013-10-27 22:39:44	angusp	Yep, check out the student satisfaction rating :D
2013-10-27 22:40:00	StrawHatter	angusp: The what?
2013-10-27 22:40:01	@KitB	Failling courses isn't a huge deal
2013-10-27 22:40:07	@KitB	s/ll/l/
2013-10-27 22:40:26	@KitB	Failing a year isn't even that big of a deal if it's first or second year
2013-10-27 22:40:50	angusp	StrawHatter: It's a rating that the uni gets from students based on how well they think shit is run
2013-10-27 22:40:57	StrawHatter	... So i could fail ILA and FP and somehow get into second year?
2013-10-27 22:41:06	@KitB	Hell yeah
2013-10-27 22:41:16	StrawHatter	... What's the point in even fucking trying now?
2013-10-27 22:41:18	@KitB	You'd resit them in second year though
2013-10-27 22:41:20	StrawHatter	Oh
2013-10-27 22:41:24	StrawHatter	Never mind then
2013-10-27 22:41:29	@KitB	You get a lot of attempts
2013-10-27 22:41:46	angusp	First year also gets you used to how the place works
2013-10-27 22:41:51	@KitB	Indeed
2013-10-27 22:41:56	angusp	ish
2013-10-27 22:42:23	StrawHatter	I feel like I've been seriously conned or something... I thought Uni was just going to be Highschool Version 2, Electric Boogaloo
2013-10-27 22:42:23	angusp	KitB: BTW, mah haskell is fine
2013-10-27 22:43:31	@KitB	that was a bit of a silly belief
2013-10-27 22:43:36	@KitB	Uni is harder than school
2013-10-27 22:43:50	@KitB	But you get the hang of it
2013-10-27 22:44:07	angusp	Less of a broad subject range, more detail
2013-10-27 22:45:05	hamhut	KitB, angusp, Sunstrike: Cant believe I missed a vim chat!!! how did this happen???
2013-10-27 22:45:09	StrawHatter	Not too mention, they really don't care if you skip things
2013-10-27 22:45:30	@KitB	StrawHatter: If you want I can see if I can find some time for some one on one sessions for Haskell?
2013-10-27 22:45:46	@KitB	angusp: Who's your tutor?
2013-10-27 22:45:48	StrawHatter	KitB: No thanks, thank you for the offer though
2013-10-27 22:45:52	angusp	hamhut: completely deliberately
2013-10-27 22:45:53	@KitB	(Same question to StrawHatter)
2013-10-27 22:46:25	StrawHatter	Um, from the one time I went to it, I had Wadler
2013-10-27 22:46:35	angusp	KitB: Jack Williams
2013-10-27 22:46:35	StrawHatter	We supposedly have a new one though
2013-10-27 22:47:03	angusp	StrawHatter: Apparently you still have him
2013-10-27 22:47:10	@KitB	oh Jack's cool
2013-10-27 22:47:16	@KitB	Friend of mine
2013-10-27 22:47:23	@KitB	He was in my team for SDP
2013-10-27 22:47:30	@KitB	and he lives above me
2013-10-27 22:47:57	@KitB	and I recall Wadler needing someone to cover a couple of his tutorials a while back
2013-10-27 22:48:01	angusp	KitB: Yeah, i like him
2013-10-27 22:48:30	@KitB	StrawHatter: Come along to my tutorial this week
2013-10-27 22:48:36	@KitB	Either of my tutorials
2013-10-27 22:49:04	@KitB	Though if you come to the 1410 on Thursday you'll be in the same one as hamhut
2013-10-27 22:49:05	angusp	btw KitB is Kit Barnes
2013-10-27 22:49:15	StrawHatter	KitB: Sorry, but I'd reaaallyy rather not...
2013-10-27 22:49:20	angusp	can I come too :p
2013-10-27 22:49:23	@KitB	Haha
2013-10-27 22:49:28	@KitB	Of course you can
2013-10-27 22:49:35	@KitB	StrawHatter: At least go to a tutorial
2013-10-27 22:49:52	@KitB	along with the labs they're the best way to learn the stuff
2013-10-27 22:50:06	angusp	StrawHatter: Seriously dude, i'll go with you if you want. Kit and Hamish aren't that scary :)
2013-10-27 22:50:45	StrawHatter	angusp: I know they aren't... I just don't want to go..
2013-10-27 22:51:12	angusp	even if you haven't done the content they're good for getting stuff explained
2013-10-27 22:52:19	@KitB	angusp: Out of interest: In what way do you know me outside of IRC?
2013-10-27 22:52:29	StrawHatter	You coming to IM tomorrow?
2013-10-27 22:52:52	angusp	KitB: Via Hamhut
2013-10-27 22:53:17	angusp	StrawHatter: Yeah, i'll see you there
2013-10-27 22:53:40	@KitB	So I know he's one of my tutees
2013-10-27 22:53:55	@KitB	I'm still not sure how that helps my understanding
2013-10-27 22:53:59	@KitB	Does he tell tales? :P
2013-10-27 22:54:28	angusp	KitB: We,, he was chuffed to bits that his tutor used vim and was on the IRC
2013-10-27 22:54:47	angusp	I think you came up during an emacs-vim argument :D
2013-10-27 22:54:53	@KitB	I am clearly the coolest tutor
2013-10-27 22:55:10	angusp	KitB: Parrot, so yeah
2013-10-27 22:55:53	@KitB	He's on my head right now
2013-10-27 22:56:31	angusp	I need to turn up to some compsoc thing with my mainframe hdd
2013-10-27 22:56:52	hamhut	just finished reading logs, 1 minute
2013-10-27 22:57:04	angusp	hamhut: Some interesting shite in the :D
2013-10-27 22:57:48	hamhut	I'm not scary, and it's right after maths... it could be fun
2013-10-27 22:58:19	angusp	hamhut: I could come and just ask kit a bunck of annoying questions... I'm quite good at them
2013-10-27 22:58:48	angusp	s/bunck/bunch
2013-10-27 22:58:54	hamhut	that would be beneficial for everyone!
2013-10-27 22:58:57	@KitB	It's true
2013-10-27 22:58:59	angusp	Import Angusp.Spelling
2013-10-27 22:59:04	@KitB	I don't get nearly enough questions
2013-10-27 22:59:06	@KitB	Oh
2013-10-27 22:59:16	@KitB	if any of you are interested in extracurricular activities
2013-10-27 22:59:23	@KitB	You should join the tardis project
2013-10-27 22:59:29	@KitB	and come to the pub with us on Mondays
2013-10-27 22:59:43	angusp	Yay! Pub!
2013-10-27 22:59:47	hamhut	what is the tardis project?
2013-10-27 22:59:56	angusp	whic pub?
2013-10-27 23:00:07	@KitB	Auld Hoose
2013-10-27 23:00:10	@KitB	Mondays at 1830
2013-10-27 23:00:19	@KitB	We eat there
2013-10-27 23:00:32	@KitB	and are sociable
2013-10-27 23:01:18	angusp	That's not too far, might give it a go, but I live with a bunch of raging alcoholics who drag me around to hive and shit
2013-10-27 23:01:47	hamhut	then be social with me!, I ignore my flatmates and hardly know their names
2013-10-27 23:02:32	angusp	hamhut: Typical compsic :D

2013-10-27 23:03:03	StrawHatter	I probably couldn't go since you know, I probably couldn't get it
2013-10-27 23:03:04	StrawHatter	in*
2013-10-27 23:03:55	angusp	StrawHatter: You'd be fine for food
2013-10-27 23:04:11	hamhut	yeah, they have to give you food!
2013-10-27 23:04:24	@KitB	Yeah the Hoose will never ID you just for being there and having food
2013-10-27 23:05:03	@KitB	Trust me I've been going for four and a half years now
2013-10-27 23:06:06	angusp	KitB: You should probably talk to someone about that :p
2013-10-27 23:06:47	@KitB	:P
2013-10-27 23:08:32	angusp	going aft for a second, just getting food
2013-10-27 23:10:06	angusp	afk
2013-10-27 23:11:01	@KitB	I was imagining that you live on a boat
2013-10-27 23:15:35	angusp	what? back now.
2013-10-27 23:15:43	@KitB	aft
2013-10-27 23:15:46	@KitB	aft of a boat
2013-10-27 23:15:58	hamhut	yes, and who doesn't like boats!!
2013-10-27 23:16:16	hamhut	KitB: have you been out onto the sea here?
2013-10-27 23:16:20	@KitB	Hell no
2013-10-27 23:16:27	@KitB	I get *really* seasick
2013-10-27 23:16:41	angusp	i like boats! Went to (ex) naval college
2013-10-27 23:17:55	hamhut	KitB, same, boats are fun though
2013-10-27 23:18:20	hamhut	I went deep sea fishing recently, basically I lay groaning on the front of the boat for 5 hours
2013-10-27 23:18:31	hamhut	I can think of better things to do
2013-10-27 23:20:03	angusp	hamhut: Sydney harbour in 5 meter swell? No wait - that's worse
2013-10-27 23:21:40	hamhut	haha, I was off the Kenyan coast... in a tiny little speed boat. I was asking for it
2013-10-27 23:24:06	@KitB	Yeah I've done going out fishing on a boat for a day
2013-10-27 23:24:11	@KitB	That was *horrible*
2013-10-27 23:24:22	@KitB	Btw I grew up in a fishing village.
2013-10-27 23:32:00	StrawHatter	okay, i'm back, wat did i miss?
2013-10-27 23:32:02	hamhut	I didn't :p, farm boy
2013-10-27 23:32:18	hamhut	and we've moved to comp-soc channel
2013-10-27 23:43:42	StrawHatter	can someone help me with a question? :/
2013-10-27 23:43:59	@KitB	Sure
2013-10-27 23:45:00	StrawHatter	nvm
2013-10-27 23:45:00	StrawHatter	i
2013-10-27 23:45:05	StrawHatter	got 2/10
2013-10-27 23:45:12	StrawHatter	which was more than i was hoping on
2013-10-27 23:53:02	hamhut	in prop_taut2 = tautology (Not p) || (not $ satisfiable p)
2013-10-27 23:53:20	hamhut	is this not what the question asks? either a or b
2013-10-27 23:53:40	hamhut	or is it asking either a or b or (a and b)
2013-10-27 23:53:54	hamhut	which would also fail in this case
2013-10-27 23:54:00	hamhut	or is it asking either a or b or (a == b)
2013-10-27 23:54:05	hamhut	would work...
2013-10-27 23:55:00	hamhut	or do I just wrap my whole thing in a not (blah) function?
2013-10-27 23:55:18	hamhut	angusp, kitb
2013-10-27 23:58:36	@KitB	one mo
2013-10-27 23:59:02	angusp	hamhut: mine is... cba copy+pasteing, look at my http://github.com/AngusP/Inf1-Haskell
2013-10-28 00:00:05	angusp	For a proposition you need to use 'Not' as well, not 'not'
2013-10-28 00:01:46	hamhut	yeah, so shouldn't it work?
2013-10-28 00:01:48	hamhut	-- either P is not satisfiable, or ~P is not a tautology
2013-10-28 00:01:53	hamhut	therefore
2013-10-28 00:02:25	hamhut	not (satisfiable p) || not (tautology (Not (p))
2013-10-28 00:02:28	hamhut	something like that
2013-10-28 00:03:17	hamhut	and it works, funny that
2013-10-28 00:03:45	angusp	We mentioned this earlier, and decided it was exclusive or, i.e. a or b but not both
2013-10-28 00:04:51	hamhut	oh, so I need a && not (a && b)?
2013-10-28 00:04:57	hamhut	on the end?
2013-10-28 00:10:21	angusp	to be honest i'm just guessing anyway :D

2013-10-28 10:54:06	StrawHatter	So uh, Guards are pretty much Haskell's answer to Case Select right?
2013-10-28 10:54:48	@KitB	sort of
2013-10-28 10:55:02	@KitB	Haskell also has a case mechanism
2013-10-28 10:55:49	@KitB	I would argue that guards are more analogous to an if statement, but considering them a case is also correct
2013-10-28 10:56:00	@KitB	as long as the case you are imagining is expressive enough

2013-10-30 16:10:48	Damodar	But it can't pass quickCheck. Also what will those patenteses change?
2013-10-30 16:12:05	hamhut	people, what's wrong with my code?

2013-10-30 16:16:46	angusp	hamhut: Optional sogo away :p
2013-10-30 16:18:04	Damodar	So well quickCheck is failing even on just simple variables like P and R. equivalent function works perfectly well, outputted True but equivalent' outputted False why so?
2013-10-30 16:18:31	Damodar	I mean *Main> equivalent' (Var "P") (Var "R")
2013-10-30 16:18:31	Damodar	False
2013-10-30 16:20:26	hamhut	yeah, that should happen damodar
2013-10-30 16:20:49	angusp	I was also confused why the exaples showed (Var "Q") isn't equiv. to (Var "V")

2013-10-30 16:26:09	angusp	Damodar: I did my first equivalent function as a recursion, so I can't compare your comprehension to it directly, but I used the same prop to generate the environments for _both_ props, so the variables have to be of the same name
2013-10-30 16:27:08	angusp	So I have guards to check if they're both tautologies, in which case they're always equivalent, then to check their names are the same, then I do the evaluation of each env
2013-10-30 16:30:40	hamhut	yeah, I'm giving up... I have an essay to write
2013-10-30 16:30:40	Damodar	So it seems that I have misunderstood the exercise. I thought it should output true even for comparing Var "P" and Var "Z" for example
2013-10-30 16:31:11	Damodar	If it shouldn't now I only need to change first function
2013-10-30 16:36:35	angusp	Damodar: That's what I thought, but talked to someone and I guess Var Q doesn't /mean/ Var P is also true. The taut (a <-> b) makes sense, and only works if they have the same variables

2013-10-30 17:01:09	StrawHatter	I've read the book's description of them around 30 times and i just don't get it
2013-10-30 17:01:19	@KitB	I'm not entirely sure what the question is
2013-10-30 17:01:21	@KitB	Which course
2013-10-30 17:01:42	StrawHatter	ILA
2013-10-30 17:03:01	@KitB	Don't think I can help you then, sorry
2013-10-30 17:03:50	edran	Okay, try to explain me what you think they are
2013-10-30 17:05:02	angusp	StrawHatter: Row space is the span of the rows of a matrix, if thy're all linearly independent, and the column space is the same for the columns of a matric. i.e. a 3x3 matrix A can be a matric of 3 3x1 column vectors or 3 1x3 row vectors
2013-10-30 17:05:05	StrawHatter	Like, a subspace but only for the rows of matrixes-
2013-10-30 17:05:29	edran	yeah, that's correct!
2013-10-30 17:05:39	edran	So where is the problem?
2013-10-30 17:06:05	edran	If you imagine row space as the set of all linear combination of the rows of a matrix, maybe it's easier to visualize
2013-10-30 17:06:13	edran	same for column space
2013-10-30 17:06:26	StrawHatter	I just keep hearing it in the lectures and I'm just sitting there like "what on earth is a row/column/null space?"
2013-10-30 17:07:13	angusp	Nullspace is the set of vectors that when you multiply any one of them by A you get the zero vector.
2013-10-30 17:07:22	edran	^ exactly
2013-10-30 17:07:41	edran	it is generally defined as k*v
2013-10-30 17:07:44	angusp	StrawHatter: check out khanacademy videos on this stuff; they're usually prety good and have a nice pace: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvyboGryeA8
2013-10-30 17:07:47	edran	where v is a 1xn vector

2013-10-30 17:09:55	@KitB	good shout angusp
2013-10-30 17:11:13	edran	yeah, KA is good for the first year courses. 
2013-10-30 17:12:06	angusp	I find it's much easier to learn if you can see+hear and also follow working in realtime
2013-10-30 17:12:38	angusp	...Guess there aren't any KA videos for the later CS stuff like AI :/
2013-10-30 17:13:20	edran	It's a good startup idea tho ;)
2013-10-30 17:13:44	angusp	edran: You'd have to fully understand it for that to work
2013-10-30 17:14:15	edran	THe thing is that you usually start learning AI when you already have some CS knowledge. And from that point, everything is basically self-taught.
2013-10-30 17:15:05	edran	Even at uni, lecturers basically outline a process, but the understanding must be reached normally via personal study.
2013-10-30 17:15:27	angusp	Yeah... I guess it's like programming languages - all you have to get is the syntax differences

2013-10-30 18:54:34	hamhut	I spent tons of time on that...
2013-10-30 18:54:40	hamhut	let me have a quick look
2013-10-30 18:55:25	hamhut	look at what you need to pass as output from the function
2013-10-30 18:55:55	hamhut	and see if you can see how you could work it so that every funtion call is returning the same data type
2013-10-30 18:56:53	Sunstrike	Remember that you can break more complex stuff down and just loop it back recursively.
2013-10-30 18:57:09	Sunstrike	And that your output is a list; Cons is your friend.

2013-10-31 12:12:54	@ChrisB	Can you give an example?

2013-10-31 12:18:00	--	Sunstrike|Off is now known as Sunstrike
2013-10-31 12:19:39	Whatever	Lets say I have some random Props:  Prop A= (Var "A" :&: Var "B") and Prop B = (Var "F" :|: Var "T")
2013-10-31 12:20:27	Whatever	and I would like to define function, which would make one big prop: (Var "A" :&: Var "B") :|: (Var "F" :|: Var "T")
2013-10-31 12:21:58	Whatever	I understand that we should do that in 4 (b): Write another version of equivalent, this time by combining the two arguments into a larger proposition
2013-10-31 12:33:24	@ChrisB	Well, your function which combines the two properties in your example is :|:
2013-10-31 12:34:25	@ChrisB	You can combine properties in any number of ways ( :&:, :->:, etc...), but of course each has a different meaning.
2013-10-31 12:35:43	@ChrisB	What 4(b) is asking is that oyu write a property which gives you the same result as the function you wrote in 4(a), rather than some new combinator.
2013-10-31 12:36:00	@ChrisB	Does this make sense?
2013-10-31 12:36:47	Whatever	It makes a lot of sense.. I guess I didn't really understand the definition of Prop
2013-10-31 12:37:31	@ChrisB	Cool :)
2013-10-31 12:37:32	Whatever	that :&: and others are not just different combinations of characters, but they actually are functions
2013-10-31 12:37:40	Whatever	bu now I do :) thanks

2013-11-03 17:49:06	StrawHatter	Um, for tutorial2 exercise 5, can I just turn the inputted char into a Int then add the inputted int to that and just convert it back to a char?
2013-11-03 17:49:47	@KitB	You could
2013-11-03 17:49:57	@KitB	ish
2013-11-03 17:50:13	StrawHatter	It wouldn't work for Z though, would it
2013-11-03 17:50:21	@KitB	You'd have to turn it into an int in the range 0..25
2013-11-03 17:50:31	@KitB	then do mod 26 on the result of the addition
2013-11-03 17:50:40	@KitB	otherwise you'd shift Z out of the alphabet, yes
2013-11-03 17:50:54	StrawHatter	ah, alright, cheers
2013-11-03 17:50:58	@KitB	But
2013-11-03 17:51:05	@KitB	You shouldn't be doing it that way anyway
2013-11-03 17:51:16	@KitB	You should be using your makeKey function
2013-11-03 17:51:23	@KitB	and your lookUp function
2013-11-03 17:51:56	StrawHatter	i should?
2013-11-03 17:52:01	@KitB	Yes.
2013-11-03 17:52:07	StrawHatter	... oh, right
2013-11-03 17:54:06	StrawHatter	oh, that works as well
2013-11-03 17:54:14	StrawHatter	Thanks :P

2013-11-03 22:58:27	angusp	StrawHatter: It's a weird type in Haskell
2013-11-03 22:58:46	Sunstrike	It's Maybe. It's hard to break down :p

2013-11-03 22:58:51	StrawHatter	is it like
2013-11-03 22:58:57	StrawHatter	haskell taking the piss?
2013-11-03 22:58:58	Sunstrike	It might be true. It might be false. Who knows? :D
2013-11-03 22:59:03	StrawHatter	computers can't do maybes
2013-11-03 22:59:03	StrawHatter	no
2013-11-03 22:59:04	StrawHatter	this is just
2013-11-03 22:59:06	StrawHatter	i can't
2013-11-03 22:59:23	StrawHatter	oh yeah
2013-11-03 22:59:28	StrawHatter	if a det (a) = 0
2013-11-03 22:59:40	StrawHatter	that implies that it there is no inverse right?
2013-11-03 23:03:35	angusp	StrawHatter: YEP!
2013-11-03 23:03:44	StrawHatter	...
2013-11-03 23:03:46	StrawHatter	Holy crackers
2013-11-03 23:03:51	StrawHatter	I actually know something from ILA
2013-11-03 23:03:54	StrawHatter	I'm celebrating! 
2013-11-03 23:03:59	 *	StrawHatter parties all night
2013-11-03 23:04:13	angusp	Basically, 'Maybe' is a way of introducing null int Haskell (called 'Nothing') and breaking apart it's pure functionness
2013-11-03 23:04:26	angusp	s/int/into
2013-11-03 23:04:48	StrawHatter	oh
2013-11-03 23:04:51	StrawHatter	...
2013-11-03 23:05:06	StrawHatter	Wowe
2013-11-03 23:05:15	StrawHatter	They could have given it a more auspiscious name 
2013-11-03 23:06:09	angusp	It's kinda a stubborn admission that sometimes things don't exist
2013-11-03 23:06:34	StrawHatter	ohhh
2013-11-03 23:06:36	StrawHatter	...
2013-11-03 23:06:38	StrawHatter	thats
2013-11-03 23:06:42	StrawHatter	preddy clever actually
2013-11-03 23:06:52	StrawHatter	when you think about what haskells used for 
2013-11-03 23:07:28	StrawHatter	oh yeah, and I actually plan on going to ILA tutorial on tuesday!~ 
2013-11-03 23:07:31	StrawHatter	This is a ste-
2013-11-03 23:07:40	StrawHatter	Then again, I kinda planned on going to the ones for the past 2 weeks...
